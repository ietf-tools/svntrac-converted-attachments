    <abstract>
      <t> This informational memo describes Datacenter TCP (DCTCP), an improvement to TCP congestion control for datacenter traffic.
      DCTCP uses improved Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the fraction of bytes that encounter congestion,
      rather than simply detecting that some congestion has occurred. DCTCP then scales the TCP congestion window based on this
      estimate. This method achieves high burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with shallow-buffered switches. This memo also
      discusses deployment issues related to the coexistence of DCTCP and conventional TCP, the lack of a negotiating mechanism between
      sender and receiver, and presents some possible mitigations.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t> Large datacenters necessarily need many network switches to interconnect their many servers.
      Therefore, a datacenter can greatly reduce its capital expenditure by leveraging low-cost switches. However, such low-cost
      switches tend to have limited queue capacities and are thus more susceptible to packet loss due to congestion.
      </t>
      <t> Network traffic in a datacenter is often a mix of short and long flows, where the short flows require low latencies and
      the long flows require high throughputs. Datacenters also experience incast bursts, where many servers send traffic to a
      single server at the same time. For example, this traffic pattern is a natural consequence of MapReduce workload: The worker nodes
      complete at approximately the same time, and all reply to the master node concurrently.
      </t>
      <t> These factors place some conflicting demands on the queue occupancy of a switch:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t> The queue must be short enough that it does not impose excessive latency on short flows.
          </t>
          <t> The queue must be long enough to buffer sufficient data for the long flows to saturate the path capacity.
          </t>
          <t> The queue must be short enough to absorb incast bursts without excessive packet loss.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t> Standard TCP congestion control <xref target="RFC5681"/> relies on packet loss to detect congestion. This does not meet
      the demands described above. First, short flows will start to experience unacceptable latencies before packet loss
      occurs. Second, by the time TCP congestion control kicks in on the senders, most of the incast burst has already been dropped.
      </t>
      <t> <xref target="RFC3168"/> describes a mechanism for using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) from the switches for 
      detection of congestion. However, this method only detects the presence of congestion, not its extent. In the presence of mild 
      congestion, the TCP congestion window is reduced too aggressively and this unnecessarily reduces the throughput of long flows.
      </t>
      <t> Datacenter TCP (DCTCP) improves traditional ECN processing by estimating the fraction of bytes that
      encounter congestion, rather than simply detecting that some congestion has occurred. DCTCP then scales the TCP congestion
      window based on this estimate. This method achieves high burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with
      shallow-buffered switches.
      </t>
      <t>
      It is recommended that DCTCP be only deployed in a datacenter environment where the endpoints and the switching fabric are under a single
      administrative domain. This protocol is not meant for uncontrolled deployment in the global Internet.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="term">
      <t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      Normative language is used to describe how necessary the various aspects of the Microsoft implementation are for interoperability, but even compliant implementations without the measures in sections 4-6 would 
      still only be safe to deploy in controlled environments.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='DCTCP Algorithm'>
      <t> There are three components involved in the DCTCP algorithm:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t> The switches (or other intermediate devices in the network) detect congestion and set the Congestion Encountered (CE)
              codepoint in the IP header.
          </t>
          <t> The receiver echoes the congestion information back to the sender, using the ECN-Echo (ECE) flag in the TCP header.
          </t>
          <t> The sender computes a congestion estimate and reacts, by reducing the TCP congestion window accordingly (cwnd).
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <section title='Marking Congestion on the Switches'>
        <t>The switches in a datacenter fabric indicate congestion to the end nodes by setting the CE codepoint in the IP header as specified in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3168"/>.
        For example, the switches may be configured with a congestion threshold. When a packet arrives at a switch and
        its queue length is greater than the congestion threshold, the switch sets the CE codepoint in the packet.
        For example, Section 3.4 of <xref target="DCTCP10"/> suggests threshold marking with a threshold K > (RTT * C)/7, where C is the link rate in packets per second.
        However, the actual algorithm for marking congestion is an implementation detail of the switch and will generally not be
        known to the sender and receiver. Therefore, sender and receiver should not assume that a particular
        marking algorithm is implemented by the switching fabric.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Echoing Congestion Information on the Receiver'>
        <t> According to Section 6.1.3 of <xref target="RFC3168"/>, the receiver sets the ECE flag if any of the packets being acknowledged had
        the CE code point set. The receiver then continues to set the ECE flag until it receives a packet with the Congestion Window Reduced (CWR)
        flag set. However, the DCTCP algorithm requires more detailed congestion information. In particular, the sender must be
        able to determine the number of bytes sent that encountered congestion. Thus, the scheme described in <xref target="RFC3168"/> does not
        suffice.
        </t>
        <t> One possible solution is to ACK every packet and set the ECE flag in the ACK if and only if the CE code point was set
        in the packet being acknowledged. However, this prevents the use of delayed ACKs, which are an important performance
        optimization in datacenters.
        </t>
        <t>Instead, DCTCP introduces a new Boolean TCP state variable, "DCTCP Congestion Encountered"
        (DCTCP.CE), which is initialized to false and stored in the
        Transmission Control Block (TCB). When sending an ACK, the ECE flag MUST be set if and only if
        DCTCP.CE is true. When receiving packets, the CE codepoint MUST be processed as follows:
          <list style='numbers'>
           <t> If the CE codepoint is set and DCTCP.CE is false, send an ACK for any previously unacknowledged packets and set
           DCTCP.CE to true.
           </t>
           <t> If the CE codepoint is not set and DCTCP.CE is true, send an ACK for any previously unacknowledged packets and set
           DCTCP.CE to false.
           </t>
           <t> Otherwise, ignore the CE codepoint.
           </t>
           </list>
        </t>
        <t> Receiver handling of the "Congestion Window Reduced" (CWR) bit is also exactly as per <xref target="RFC3168"/>
        including <xref target="RFC3168-ERRATA3639"/>. That is, on receipt of a segment with both the CE and CWR bits set, CWR is processed first and then
        ECE is processed.
        </t>

      <section title='Processing Congestion Indications on the Sender' anchor='senderprocessing'>
        <t> The sender estimates the fraction of bytes sent that encountered congestion. The current estimate is stored in a new
        TCP state variable, DCTCP.Alpha, which is initialized to 1 and SHOULD be updated as follows:
          <list>
            <t> DCTCP.Alpha = DCTCP.Alpha * (1 - g) + g * M </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> where
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t> g is the estimation gain, a real number between 0 and 1. The selection of g is left to the implementation.
            See <xref target="implissues"/> for further considerations.
            </t>
            <t> M is the fraction of bytes sent that encountered congestion during the previous observation window, where the
            observation window is chosen to be approximately the Round Trip Time (RTT). In particular, an observation window
            ends when all bytes in flight at the beginning of the window have been acknowledged.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> In order to update DCTCP.Alpha, the TCP state variables defined in <xref target="RFC0793"/> are used, and
        three additional TCP state variables are introduced:
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t> DCTCP.WindowEnd: The TCP sequence number threshold for beginning a new observation window; initialized to
            SND.UNA.
            </t>
            <t> DCTCP.BytesSent: The number of bytes sent during the current observation window; initialized to zero.
            </t>
            <t> DCTCP.BytesMarked: The number of bytes sent during the current observation window that encountered congestion; initialized
            to zero.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> The congestion estimator on the sender SHOULD process acceptable ACKs as follows:
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t> Compute the bytes acknowledged (TCP SACK options <xref target="RFC2018"/> are ignored for this computation):
              <list style='none'>
                <t> BytesAcked = SEG.ACK - SND.UNA </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t> Update the bytes sent:
              <list style='none'>
                <t> DCTCP.BytesSent += BytesAcked </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t> If the ECE flag is set, update the bytes marked:
              <list style='none'>
                <t> DCTCP.BytesMarked += BytesAcked </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t> If the acknowledgment number is less than or equal to DCTCP.WindowEnd, stop processing. Otherwise,
            the end of the observation window has been reached, so proceed to update the congestion estimate as follows:
            </t>
            <t> Compute the congestion level for the current observation window:
              <list style='none'>
                <t> M = DCTCP.BytesMarked / DCTCP.BytesSent </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t> Update the congestion estimate:
              <list style='none'>
                <t> DCTCP.Alpha = DCTCP.Alpha * (1 - g) + g * M </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t> Determine the end of the next observation window:
              <list style='none'>
                <t> DCTCP.WindowEnd = SND.NXT </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t> Reset the byte counters:
              <list style='none'>
                <t> DCTCP.BytesSent = DCTCP.BytesMarked = 0 </t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Rather than always halving the congestion window as described in <xref target="RFC3168"/>, when the sender receives an
        indication of congestion (ECE), the sender SHOULD update cwnd as follows:
          <list>
            <t> cwnd = cwnd * (1 - DCTCP.Alpha / 2)
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> Thus, when no bytes sent experienced congestion, DCTCP.Alpha equals zero, and cwnd is left unchanged. When all sent
        bytes experienced congestion, DCTCP.Alpha equals one, and cwnd is reduced by half. Lower levels of congestion will result
        in correspondingly smaller reductions to cwnd.
        </t>
        <t> Just as specified in <xref target="RFC3168"/>, DCTCP does not react to congestion indications more than once for every
        window of data. The setting of the "Congestion Window Reduced" (CWR) bit is also as per <xref target="RFC3168"/>. This is required
        for interop with classic ECN receivers due to potential misconfigurations.
        </t>
        <t> A DCTCP sender MUST deal with loss episodes in the same way as conventional TCP. In case of a timeout or
        fast retransmit or any change in delay (for delay based congestion control), the cwnd and other state variables like ssthresh must be
        changed in the same way that a conventional TCP would have changed them. 
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Handling of SYN, SYN-ACK, RST Packets'>
        <t> <xref target="RFC3168"/> requires that a compliant TCP MUST NOT set ECT on SYN or SYN-ACK packets. <xref target="RFC5562"/>
        proposes setting ECT on SYN-ACK packets, but maintains the restriction of no ECT on SYN packets. Both these RFCs prohibit
        ECT in SYN packets due to security concerns regarding malicious SYN packets with ECT set. These RFCs, however, are intended
        for general Internet use, and do not directly apply to a controlled datacenter environment. The switching fabric can drop TCP
        packets that do not have the ECT set in the IP header. If SYN and SYN-ACK packets for DCTCP connections do not have ECT set, they will
        be dropped with high probability. For DCTCP connections, the sender SHOULD set ECT for SYN, SYN-ACK and RST packets. The security concerns 
        addressed by both these RFCs might not apply in controlled environments like datacenters, and it might not be necessary to cater to both the 
        presence of non-ECN servers.

        </t>
      </section>

     </section>

    <section title='Implementation Issues' anchor="implissues">
      <t> As noted in <xref target='senderprocessing' />, the implementation will need to choose a suitable estimation gain.
      <xref target='DCTCP10' /> provides a theoretical basis for selecting the gain. However, it may be more practical to use
      experimentation to select a suitable gain for a particular network and workload. The Microsoft implementation of DCTCP
      in Windows Server 2012 uses a fixed estimation gain of 1/16.
      </t>
      <t> The implementation must also decide when to use DCTCP. Datacenter servers may need to communicate with endpoints outside
      the datacenter, where DCTCP is unsuitable or unsupported. Thus, a global configuration setting to enable DCTCP will
      generally not suffice. DCTCP provides no mechanism for negotiating its use. Thus, there is additional management and configuration overhead
      required to ensure that DCTCP is not used with non-DCTCP endpoints.
      </t>
      <t>Potential solutions rely on either configuration or heuristics. Heuristics need to allow endpoints to individually
      enable DCTCP, to ensure a DCTCP sender is always paired with a DCTCP receiver.
      One approach is to enable DCTCP based on the IP address of the remote endpoint. Another approach is to
      detect connections that transmit within the bounds a datacenter. For example, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 (and later versions) supports automatic
      selection of DCTCP if the estimated RTT is less than 10 msec and ECN is successfully negotiated, under the assumption that if the RTT is low, then
      the two endpoints are likely in the same datacenter network.
      </t>
      <t> <xref target="RFC3168"/> forbids the ECN-marking of pure ACK packets, because of the inability of TCP to mitigate ACK-path congestion 
      and the extra advantage to injection attackers that ECN is perceived to offer. For the latter reason RFC 3168 also forbids ECN-marking of 
      retransmissions, window probes and RSTs. However, dropping all these control packets - rather than ECN marking them - has considerable performance disadvantages.  It is 
      RECOMMENDED that an implementation provide a configuration knob that will cause ECT to be set on such control packes, which can be used in 
      environments where such concerns do not apply.
      </t> 
      <t> It would be useful to implement DCTCP as additional actions on top of an existing congestion control algorithm like NewReno. The DCTCP
      implementation MAY also allow configuration of resetting the value of DCTCP.Alpha as part of processing any loss episodes.
      </t>
      <t> The DCTCP.Alpha calculation as per the formula in <xref target='senderprocessing' /> involves fractions. An efficient kernel implementation
      MAY scale the DCTCP.Alpha value for efficient computation using shift operations. For example, if the implementation chooses
      g as 1/16, multiplications of DCTCP.Alpha by g become right-shifts by 4.
      A scaling implementation SHOULD ensure that DCTCP.Alpha is able to reach zero once it falls below the smallest shifted value (16 in the above example).
      At the other extreme, a scaled update MUST also ensure DCTCP.Alpha does not exceed the scaling factor, which would be equivalent to greater than
      100% congestion.  So, DCTCP.Alpha MUST be clamped after an update.
      </t>
      <t> This results in the following computations replacing steps 5 and 6 in <xref target='senderprocessing' />, where SCF is the chosen
      scaling factor (65536 in the example) and SHF is the shift factor (4 in the example):
        <list style='numbers'>
	        <t> Compute the congestion level for the current observation window:

    <section title='Deployment Issues'>
      <t> DCTCP and conventional TCP congestion control do not coexist well in the same network. In DCTCP, the marking threshold is set to a very low
      value to reduce queueing delay, and a relatively small amount of congestion will exceed the marking threshold. During such periods
      of congestion, conventional TCP will suffer packet loss and quickly and drastically reduce cwnd. DCTCP, on the other hand, will use the fraction
      of marked packets to reduce cwnd more gradually. Thus, the rate reduction in DCTCP will be much slower than that of conventional TCP, and DCTCP traffic
      will gain a larger share of the capacity compared to conventional TCP traffic traversing the same path. If the traffic in the datacenter is a mix of conventional TCP
      and DCTCP, it is RECOMMENDED that DCTCP traffic be segregated from conventional TCP traffic. <xref target='MORGANSTANLEY' /> describes
      a deployment that uses the IP DSCP bits to segregate the network such that AQM is applied to DCTCP traffic, whereas TCP traffic is managed via drop-tail queueing.
      </t>
      <t> Deployments should take into account segregation of non-TCP traffic as well. Today's commodity switches allow configuration of different marking/drop 
      profiles for non-TCP and non-IP packets. Non-TCP and non-IP packets should be able to pass through such switches, unless they really run out 
      of buffer space. 
      </t>
      <t> Since DCTCP relies on congestion marking by the switches, DCTCP's potential can only be realized in datacenters where the entire network
      infrastructure supports ECN. The switches may also support configuration of the congestion threshold used for marking.
      The proposed parameterization can be configured with switches that implement RED. <xref target='DCTCP10' /> provides a theoretical
      basis for selecting the congestion threshold, but as with the estimation gain, it may be more practical to rely on experimentation or
      simply to use the default configuration of the device. DCTCP will degrade to loss-based congestion control when transiting a
      congested drop-tail link.
      </t>
      <t> DCTCP requires changes on both the sender and the receiver, so both endpoints must support DCTCP. Furthermore, DCTCP
      provides no mechanism for negotiating its use, so both endpoints must be configured through some out-of-band mechanism to
      use DCTCP. A variant of DCTCP that can be deployed unilaterally and only requires standard ECN behavior has been described
      in <xref target="ODCTCP"/><xref target="BSDCAN"/>, but requires additional experimental evaluation.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Known Issues'>
      <t> DCTCP relies on the sender's ability to reconstruct the stream of CE codepoints received by the remote endpoint. To
      accomplish this, DCTCP avoids using a single ACK packet to acknowledge segments received both with and without the CE
      codepoint set. However, if one or more ACK packets are dropped, it is possible that a subsequent ACK will cumulatively acknowledge
      a mix of CE and non-CE segments. This will, of course, result in a less accurate congestion estimate. There are some potential considerations:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t> Even with an inaccurate congestion estimate, DCTCP may still perform better than <xref target="RFC3168"/>.
          </t>
          <t> If the estimation gain is small relative to the packet loss rate, the estimate may not be too inaccurate.
          </t>
          <t> If packet loss mostly occurs under heavy congestion, most drops will occur during an unbroken string of CE packets,
          and the estimate will be unaffected.
          </t>
        </list>
      However, the effect of packet drops on DCTCP under real world conditions has not been analyzed.
      </t>
      <t> DCTCP provides no mechanism for negotiating its use. The effect of using DCTCP with a standard ECN endpoint
      has been analyzed in <xref target="ODCTCP"/><xref target="BSDCAN"/>. Furthermore, it is possible that other implementations may also modify
      <xref target="RFC3168"/> behavior without negotiation, causing further interoperability issues.
      </t>
      <t> Much like standard TCP, DCTCP is biased against flows with longer RTTs. A method for improving the RTT fairness of DCTCP
      has been proposed in <xref target="ADCTCP"/>, but requires additional experimental evaluation.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Implementation Status'>
      <t> This section documents the implementation status of the specification in this document, as recommended by <xref target="RFC6982"/>.
      </t>
      <t> This document describes DCTCP as implemented in Microsoft Windows Server 2012. Since publication of the first versions of this
      document, the Linux <xref target="LINUX"/> and FreeBSD <xref target="FREEBSD"/> operating systems have also implemented support for DCTCP in
      a way that is believed to follow this document.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Security Considerations'>
      <t> DCTCP enhances ECN and thus inherits the security considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC3168"/>. The processing
      changes introduced by DCTCP do not exacerbate these considerations or introduce new ones. In particular, with either
      algorithm, the network infrastructure or the remote endpoint can falsely report congestion and thus cause the sender to
      reduce cwnd. However, this is no worse than what can be achieved by simply dropping packets.
