      <t>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report
      (XR) Block that allows the reporting of Burst and Gap Loss metrics for
      use in a range of RTP applications.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <section title="Burst and Gap Loss Report Block">
        <t>This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
        <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> for use in a range of RTP applications.
        The new block type supports the reporting of the proportion of packets
        lost by the network. The losses during loss bursts are reported,
        together with the number of bursts and additional data, allowing the
        calculation of statistical parameters (mean and variance) of the
        distribution of burst lengths. Some uses of these metrics depend on
        the availability of the metric "cumulative number of packets lost"
        from RTCP <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This block provides information on transient IP problems. Burst/Gap
        metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports; however, they also
        may be used in Interval reports. The burstiness of packet loss affects
        user experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the
        problem, and may also have diagnostic value.</t>

        <t>The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end system
        metrics defined in <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The definitions of "burst", "gap", "loss", and "discard" are consistent with
        definitions in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. To accommodate the
        range of jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that may be
        used by implementors, the method used to distinguish between bursts
        and gaps may be an equivalent method to that defined in <xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref>. The method used should produce the same
        result as that defined in <xref target="RFC3611"/> for conditions of burst packet
        loss but may produce different results for conditions of time varying
        jitter.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defines an
        extensible structure for reporting by using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This document defines a new Extended Report block for use with <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The "Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework" <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guidelines for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The Metrics Block described in this document is in
        accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability" anchor="applicability">
        <t>These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications that
        contain jitter buffers and don't use stream repair means, e.g.,
        Forward Error Correction (FEC) <xref target="RFC5109"></xref> and/or
        retransmission <xref target="RFC4588"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are defined:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Received, Lost, and Discarded"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to
            arrive within an implementation-specific time window. A packet
            that arrives within this time window but is too early or late to
            be played out or thrown away before playout due to packet
            duplication or redundancy shall be regarded as discarded. A packet
            shall be classified as one of received (or OK), discarded, or lost.
            The metric "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in <xref
            target="RFC3550"></xref> reports a count of packets lost from the
            media stream (single Synchronization Source (SSRC) within a single RTP session). Similarly,
            the metric "number of packets discarded" defined in <xref
            target="DISCARD"></xref> reports a count of packets discarded from
            the media stream (single SSRC within single RTP session) arriving
            at the receiver. Another metric defined in <xref
            target="RFC5725"></xref> is available to report on packets that
            are not recovered by any repair techniques that may be in use.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Bursts and Gaps"><vspace blankLines="1" />The terms
            "burst" and "gap" are used in a manner consistent with that of RTCP XR
            <xref target="RFC3611"/>. RTCP XR views an RTP stream as being divided into
            bursts, which are periods when the loss rate is high
            enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally over 5
            percent loss rate) and gaps, which are periods when lost
            packets are infrequent and hence quality is generally acceptable.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
          </list></t>

    </section>

    <section title="Burst/Gap Loss Block" anchor="BGLB">
      <t>Metrics in this block report on Burst/Gap Loss in the stream arriving
      at the RTP system. The measurement of these metrics is made at the
      receiving end of the RTP stream. Instances of this Metrics Block refer
      by SSRC to the separate auxiliary Measurement
      Information block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>, which describes
      measurement periods in use (see RFC 6776, Section 4.2).</t>

      <t>This Metrics Block relies on the measurement period in the
      Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report. Senders
      MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the Measurement
      Information Block. Receivers MUST verify that the measurement period is
      received in the same compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block. If not,
      this Metrics Block MUST be discarded.</t>

      <section title="Report Block Structure">
        <t>The structure of the Burst/Gap Loss metrics block is as follows.

            <t
            hangText=" Loss and Discard Combination flag (C): 1 bit"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The 'C' flag is used to indicate whether the

            the same compound RTCP packet. The value is set to '1' if the
            loss/discard report and the burst gap loss report are combined.
            Otherwise, the value is set to '0'. If the 'C' flag is set to '1'

            to and following a lost packet in order for this lost packet to be
            regarded as part of a gap. Note that the threshold is calculated
            in accordance with the Gmin Calculation defined in Section 4.7.2 of

      <section title="Derived Metrics Based on Reported Metrics">
        <t>The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
        this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
        Information Block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref> and also with the
        metric "cumulative number of packets lost" provided in standard RTCP
        <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>These metrics provide information relevant to statistical
        parameters, including:<list style="symbols">
            <t>the fraction of packets lost during bursts (i.e., Burst Loss

    <section title="Considerations for Voice-over-IP Applications">
      <t>This Metrics Block is applicable to a broad range of RTP
      applications. Where the metric is used with a Voice-over-IP (VoIP)
      application and the stream repair means is not available, the following
      considerations apply.</t>

      <t>RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
      when the loss rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
      quality degradation (generally over 5 percent loss rate), and gaps,
      which are periods when lost packets are infrequent and hence
      call quality is generally acceptable.</t>

      <t>If Voice Activity Detection is used, the Burst and Gap Duration shall
      be determined as if silence packets had been sent, i.e., a period of
      silence in excess of Gmin packets will terminate a burst condition.</t>

      <t>The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in <xref target="RFC3611"/> results in
      a Burst being a period of time during which the call quality is degraded
      to a similar extent to a typical Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Severely
      Errored Second.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This block does not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to
      confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of <xref
      target="RFC3611"></xref> does not apply. However, the gaps indicated
      within this block could be used to detect the timing of other events on
      the path between the sender and receiver. For example, a competing
      multimedia stream might cause a loss burst for the duration of the
      stream, allowing the receiver of this block to know when the competing
      stream was active. This risk is not a significant threat since the only
      information leaked is the timing of the loss, not the cause. Besides
      this, it is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces
      no other new security considerations beyond those described in <xref
      target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>

memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides
end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting
real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or
unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does
not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport
is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data
delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide
minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to
be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol
supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this
memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes
in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms
governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to
the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order
to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants
join a session
simultaneously. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front><seriesInfo name="STD"

using various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel

loss situation.  This scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable
