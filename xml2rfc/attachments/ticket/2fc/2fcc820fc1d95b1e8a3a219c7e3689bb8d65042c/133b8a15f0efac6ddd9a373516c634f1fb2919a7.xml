      <t>This document introduces the FCAST reliable object (e.g., file)
      delivery application. It is designed to operate either on top of the
      underlying Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) / Layered Coding Transport
      (LCT) reliable multicast transport protocol or the NACK-Oriented
      Reliable Multicast (NORM) transport protocol.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <!-- ==================================== -->

      <t>This document introduces the FCAST reliable and scalable object
      (e.g., file) delivery application. Two variants of FCAST exist: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>FCAST/ALC, which relies on the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC)
          <xref target="RFC5775"/> and Layered Coding Transport (LCT)
          <xref target="RFC5651"/> reliable multicast transport protocol,
          and</t>

          <t>FCAST/NORM, which relies on the NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast
          (NORM) <xref target="RFC5740"/> transport protocol.</t>

        </list> Hereafter, the term "FCAST" denotes either FCAST/ALC or
      FCAST/NORM. FCAST is not a new protocol specification per se. Instead, it
      is a set of data format specifications and instructions on how to use
      ALC and NORM to implement a file-casting service.</t>

      <t>FCAST is expected to work in many different environments and is
      designed to be flexible. The service provided by FCAST can differ
      according to the exact conditions under which FCAST is used.
      For instance, the
      delivery service provided by FCAST might be fully reliable, or only
      partially reliable, depending upon the exact way FCAST is used. Indeed,
      if FCAST/ALC is used for a finite duration over purely unidirectional
      networks (where no feedback is possible), a fully reliable service may
      not be possible in practice. This is different with NORM, which can
      collect reception and loss feedback from receivers. This is discussed
      in <xref target="op_considerations"/>.</t>

      <t>The delivery service provided by FCAST might also differ in terms of
      scalability with respect to the number of receivers. The FCAST/ALC
      service is naturally massively scalable, since neither FCAST nor ALC
      limits the number of receivers (there is no feedback message at all).
      Conversely, the scalability of FCAST/NORM is typically limited by NORM
      itself,
      as NORM relies on feedback messages from the receivers. However,
      NORM is designed in such a way to offer a reasonably scalable
      service (e.g., through the use of proactive Forward Error Correction
      (FEC) codes <xref target="RFC6363"/>), and so does the service
      provided by FCAST/NORM. This aspect is also discussed
      in <xref target="op_considerations"/>.</t>

      <t>A design goal behind FCAST is to define a streamlined solution, in
      order to enable lightweight implementations of the protocol stack and to
      limit the operational processing and storage requirements. A consequence
      of this choice is that FCAST cannot be considered a versatile
      application capable of addressing all the possible use-cases. On the
      contrary, FCAST has some intrinsic limitations. From this point of view,
      it differs from the File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport
      (FLUTE) <xref target="RFC6726"/>, which favors flexibility
      at the expense of some additional complexity.</t>

      <t>A good example of the design choices meant to favor simplicity is the
      way FCAST manages the object metadata: by default, the metadata and
      the object content are sent together, in a Compound Object. This
      solution has many advantages in terms of simplicity, as will be described
      later on. However, this solution has an intrinsic limitation, since it
      does not enable a receiver to decide in advance, before beginning the
      reception of the Compound Object, whether the object is of interest or
      not, based on the information that may be provided in the metadata.
      Therefore, this document discusses additional techniques that may be used
      to mitigate this limitation. When use-cases require that each receiver
      download the whole set of objects sent in the session (e.g., with
      mirroring tools), this limitation is not considered a problem.</t>

      <t>Finally, <xref target="compliance_requirements"/> provides guidance
      for compliant implementation of the specification and identifies those
      features that are optional.</t>

          <ttcol align="left">Description</ttcol>

          <c>Version</c>

          <c>3-bit field that MUST be set to 0 in this specification and
          that indicates the FCAST protocol version number.</c>

          <c>Reserved</c>

          <c>3-bit field that MUST be set to 0 in this specification and is
          reserved for future use. &nbsp;Receivers MUST ignore this field.</c>

          <c>G</c>

          <c>1-bit field that, when set to 1, indicates that the checksum
          encompasses the whole Compound Object (Global checksum). &nbsp;When
          set to 0, this field indicates that the checksum encompasses only the
          FCAST Header.</c>

          <c>C</c>

          <c>1-bit field that, when set to 1, indicates that the object is a
          CID. &nbsp;When set to 0, this field indicates that the transported
          object is a standard object.</c>

          <c>Metadata Format (MDFmt)</c>

          <c>4-bit field that defines the format of the Object Metadata field
          (see <xref target="iana"/>). &nbsp;An HTTP/1.1 metainformation
          format <xref target="RFC2616"/> MUST be supported and is associated
          to value 0. &nbsp;Other formats (e.g., XML) may be defined in the
          future.</c>

          <c>Metadata Encoding (MDEnc)</c>

          <c>4-bit field that defines the optional encoding of the Object
          Metadata field (see <xref target="iana"/>). &nbsp;Two values are
          currently defined. &nbsp;A value of 0 indicates that the field
          contains UTF-8 encoded <xref target="RFC3629"/> text. &nbsp;A
          value of 1 indicates that the field contains GZIP <xref
          target="RFC1952"/> compressed UTF-8 encoded text.</c>

          <c>Checksum</c>

          <c>16-bit field that contains the checksum computed over either the
          whole Compound Object (when G is set to 1) or over the FCAST Header
          (when G is set to 0), using the Internet checksum algorithm
          specified in <xref target="RFC1071"/>. &nbsp;More precisely,
          the Checksum field is the 16-bit one's complement
          of the one's complement sum of
          all 16-bit words to be considered. &nbsp;If a segment contains an odd
          number of octets to be checksummed, the last octet is padded on the
          right with zeros to form a 16-bit word for checksum purposes (this
          pad is not transmitted). &nbsp;While computing the checksum,
          the Checksum field itself MUST be set to zero.</c>

          <c>FCAST Header Length</c>

          <c>32-bit field indicating total length (in bytes) of all fields of
          the FCAST Header, except the optional padding. &nbsp;An
          FCAST Header Length field set to value 8 means that there is no
          metadata
          included. &nbsp;When this size is not a multiple of 32-bit words and
          when the FCAST Header is followed by non-null Object Data, padding
          MUST be added. &nbsp;It should be noted that the Object Metadata
          field maximum size is equal to (2^32 - 8) bytes.</c>

          <c>Object Metadata</c>

          <c>Variable-length field that contains the metadata associated to
          the object. &nbsp;The format and encoding of this field are defined
          by the MDFmt and MDEnc fields, respectively. &nbsp;With the default
          format and encoding, the Object Metadata field, if not empty,
          MUST contain UTF-8 encoded text that follows the "TYPE" ":" "VALUE"
          "&lt;CR-LF&gt;" format used in HTTP/1.1 for metainformation <xref
          target="RFC2616"/>. &nbsp;The various metadata items can appear in
          any order. &nbsp;The receiver MUST NOT assume that this string is
          NULL-terminated. &nbsp;When no metadata is communicated, this
          field MUST be empty and the FCAST Header Length MUST be equal to 8.</c>

          <c>Padding</c>

          <c>Optional, variable-length field of zero-value bytes to align the
          start of the Object Data to a 32-bit boundary. &nbsp;Padding is
          only used when the FCAST Header Length value, in bytes, is not a
          multiple of 4 and when the FCAST Header is followed by non-null
          Object Data.</c>
        </texttable>
   <?rfc compact="yes"?>

        <t>The FCAST Header is then followed by the Object Data, i.e., either
        an original object (possibly encoded by FCAST) or a CID. Note that the
        length of the Object Data content is the ALC or NORM transported
        object length (e.g., as specified by the FEC OTI) minus the FCAST
        Header Length and optional padding, if any.</t>

        <t>Because the CID is transmitted as a special Compound Object, the

            <t>Fcast-CID-Complete: this is an optional entry that, when set to
            "Fcast-CID-Complete: 1", indicates no new object (if we ignore CID
            Compound Objects) in addition to the ones whose TOIs are listed in
            this CID or the ones that have been listed in the previous CID(s),
            will be sent in the future. Conversely, if it is set to

            that the session is not complete. An FCAST sender MUST NOT use
            any other value for this entry.</t>

            <t>Fcast-CID-ID: this entry contains the Carousel Instance
            IDentifier, or CIID. It starts from 0 upon FCAST session creation
            and is incremented by 1 for each new Carousel Instance. This entry
            is optional if the FCAST session consists of a single, complete
            Carousel Instance (no need for the FCAST sender to specify it and
            for the FCAST receiver to process it). In all other cases, this
            entry MUST be defined. In particular, the CIID is used by the TOI
            equivalence mechanism, thanks to which any object is uniquely
            identified, even if the TOI is updated (e.g., after re-enqueuing
            the object with NORM). The Fcast-CID-ID value can also be useful
            for detecting possible gaps in the Carousel Instances,
            for instance, gaps
            caused by long disconnection periods. Finally, it can also be
            useful for avoiding problems when TOI wrapping to 0 takes place to
            differentiate the various incarnations of the TOIs if need be.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The following standard metadata entry types are also used (<xref
        target="metadata_content"/>): <list style="symbols">
            <t>Content-Length: specifies the size in bytes of the Object List,
            before any content encoding (if any).</t>

            <t>Content-Encoding: specifies the optional encoding of the
            Object List, performed by FCAST.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>An empty Object List is valid and indicates that the current
        Carousel Instance does not include any objects (<xref target="cio"/>).
        This can be specified by using the following metadata entry: <figure>
            <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[      Content-Length: 0  ]]></artwork>
          </figure> or simply by leaving the Object List empty. In both cases,
        padding MUST NOT be used, and consequently the ALC or NORM transported
        object length (e.g., as specified by the FEC OTI) minus the FCAST
        Header Length equals zero.</t>

        <t>The Object List, when non-empty and with MDEnc=0, is UTF-8-encoded
        text that is not necessarily NULL-terminated. It can contain two
        things:

        <list style="symbols">
            <t>a list of TOI values, and</t>

            <t>a list of TOI equivalences.</t>
          </list>A list of TOIs included in the current Carousel Instance is
        specified as an ASCII string containing comma-delimited individual TOI
        values and/or TOI intervals. Individual TOIs consist of a single
        integer value, while TOI intervals are a hyphen-delimited pair of TOI
        values to indicate an inclusive range of TOI values (e.g., "1,2,4-6"
        would indicate the list of TOI values of 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6). For a TOI
        interval indicated by "TOI_a-TOI_b", the "TOI_a" value MUST be
        strictly inferior to the "TOI_b" value. If a TOI wrapping to 0 occurs
        in an interval, then two TOI intervals MUST be specified:
        TOI_a-MAX_TOI and 0-TOI_b.</t>

        <t>This string can also contain the TOI equivalences, if any. The
        format is a comma-separated list of equivalence TOI value pairs with a
        delimiting equals sign '=' to indicate the equivalence assignment
        (e.g., " newTOI "=" 1stTOI "/" 1stCIID "). Each equivalence indicates
        that the new TOI, for the current Carousel Instance, is equivalent to
        (i.e., refers to the same object as) the provided identifier, 1stTOI,
        for the Carousel Instance of ID 1stCIID. In the case of the NORM
        protocol, where NormTransportId values need to monotonically increase
        for NACK-based protocol operation, this allows an object from a prior
        Carousel Instance to be relisted in a subsequent Carousel Instance
        with the receiver set informed of the equivalence so that unnecessary
        retransmission requests can be avoided.</t>

        <t>The ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/> is as follows:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[cid-list     =  *(list-elem *( "," list-elem))
list-elem    =  toi-elem / toieq-elem
toi-elem     =  toi-value / toi-interval
toi-value    =  1*DIGIT
toi-interval =  toi-value "-" toi-value
                ; additionally, the first toi-value MUST be
                ; strictly inferior to the second toi-value
toieq-elem   =  "(" toi-value "=" toi-value "/" ciid-value ")"
ciid-value   =  1*DIGIT
DIGIT        =  %x30-39
                ; a digit between 0 and 9, inclusive]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>For readability purposes and to simplify processing, the TOI values
        in the list MUST be given in increasing order, handling wrap of the TOI
        space appropriately. TOI equivalence elements MUST be grouped together
        at the end of the list in increasing newTOI order. Specifying a TOI
        equivalence for a given newTOI relieves the sender from specifying
        newTOI explicitly in the TOI list. A receiver MUST be able to handle
        situations where the same TOI appears both in the TOI value and TOI
        equivalence lists. Finally, a given TOI value or TOI equivalence item
        MUST NOT be included multiple times in either list.</t>

        <t>For instance, the following Object List specifies that the current
        Carousel Instance is composed of 8 objects, and that TOIs 100 to 104
        are equivalent to TOIs 10 to 14 of Carousel Instance ID 2 and
        refer to the same objects:</t>

      <!-- ==================================== -->

      <t>This section details the principles of FCAST.</t>

      <section anchor="fcast_service" title="FCAST Content Delivery Service">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The basic goal of FCAST is to transmit objects to a group of
        receivers in a reliable way, where the receiver set may be restricted
        to a single receiver or may include possibly a very large number of
        receivers. FCAST supports two forms of operation: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>FCAST/ALC, where the FCAST application works on top of the
            ALC/LCT reliable multicast transport protocol, without any
            feedback from the receivers, and</t>

            <t>FCAST/NORM, where the FCAST application works on top of the
            NORM transport protocol, which requires positive/negative
            acknowledgments from the receivers.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This specification is designed such that both forms of operation
        share as much commonality as possible. <xref
        target="op_considerations"/> discusses some operational aspects and
        the content delivery service that is provided by FCAST for a given
        use-case.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="metadata_tx"
               title="Compound Object and Metadata Transmission">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>FCAST carries metadata elements by prepending them to the object
        they refer to. As a result, a Compound Object is created that is
        composed of an FCAST Header followed by the Object Data (<xref
        target="fig_compound_obj"/>). This header is itself composed of the
        object metadata (if any) as well as several fields (e.g., to indicate
        format, encoding, or boundaries (<xref target="compound_obj_format"/>)).</t>

        <figure anchor="fig_compound_obj" title="Compound Object Composition">
          <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
<------------------------ Compound Object ----------------------->

| (can include metadata)  |       (can be encoded by FCAST)      |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Attaching the metadata to the object is an efficient solution,
        since it guarantees that metadata are received along with the
        associated object, and it allows the transport of the metadata to
        benefit from any transport-layer erasure protection of the Compound
        Object (e.g., using FEC encoding and/or NACK-based repair). However, a
        limit of this scheme is that a client does not know the metadata of
        an object before beginning its reception, and in the case of erasures
        affecting the metadata, not until the object decoding is completed.
        The details of course depend upon the transport protocol and the FEC
        code used.</t>

        <t><xref target="annex_add_meta_data_tx_mechanisms"/> describes

        communicate metadata ahead of time.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="metadata_content" title="Metadata Content">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The following metadata types are defined in <xref
        target="RFC2616"/>: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Content-Location: the URI of the object, which gives the name
            and location of the object.</t>

            <t>Content-Type: a string that contains the MIME type of the
            object.</t>

            <t>Content-Length: an unsigned 64-bit integer that contains the
            size in bytes of the initial object, before any content encoding
            (if any) and without considering the FCAST Header. Note that the
            use of certain FEC schemes MAY further limit the maximum value of
            the object.</t>

            <t>Content-Encoding: a string that contains the optional encoding
            of the object performed by FCAST. For instance:

 <figure> <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[         Content-Encoding: gzip
]]></artwork> </figure>

            indicates that the object has been encoded
            with GZIP <xref target="RFC1952"/>. If there is no
            Content-Encoding entry, the receiver MUST assume that FCAST did
            not modify the original encoding of the object (default).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The following additional metadata types are defined to check object
        integrity: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Fcast-Obj-Digest-SHA256: a string that contains the "base64"
            <xref target="RFC4648"/> encoding of the SHA-256 message digest of
            the object <xref target="RFC3174"/> <xref target="RFC6234"/>,
            before any content encoding is applied (if any) and without
            considering the FCAST Header. 
            This digest is meant to protect from transmission and processing
            errors, not from deliberate attacks by an intelligent attacker
            (see <xref target="security"/>). This digest only protects the
            object, not the header, and therefore not the metadata. A
            separate checksum is provided for that purpose (<xref
            target="compound_obj_format"/>).</t>

     <t>Fcast-Obj-Digest-SHA1: similar to Fcast-Obj-Digest-SHA256,
            except that SHA-256 is replaced by SHA-1. An FCAST sender
            MAY include both an Fcast-Obj-Digest-SHA1 and an
            Fcast-Obj-Digest-SHA256 message digest in the metadata, in order
            to let a receiver select the most appropriate algorithm (e.g.,
            depending on local processing power).</t>
          </list></t>

     <t>The following additional metadata types are used for dealing with
        very large objects (e.g., objects that largely exceed the working
        memory of a
        receiver). When this happens, the metadata associated to each
        sub-object MUST include the following entries: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Nb: an unsigned 32-bit integer that contains
            the total number of slices. A value greater than 1 indicates that
            this object is the result of a split of the original object.</t>

            <t>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Idx: an unsigned 32-bit integer that contains
            the slice index (in the {0 .. SliceNb - 1} interval).</t>

            <t>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Offset: an unsigned 64-bit integer that
            contains the offset at which this slice starts within the original
            object.</t>
          </list>  Future IANA assignments to extend the set of metadata
          types supported by FCAST are to be made through Expert Review
          <xref target="RFC5226"/>.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="carousel" title="Carousel Transmission">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>A set of FCAST Compound Objects scheduled for transmission is
        considered a logical "Carousel". A given "Carousel Instance" is
        comprised of a fixed set of Compound Objects. Whenever the FCAST
        application needs to add new Compound Objects to or remove old
        Compound Objects from the transmission set, a new Carousel Instance is
        defined, since the set of Compound Objects changes. Because of the
        native object multiplexing capability of both ALC and NORM, a sender
        and receiver(s) are both capable of multiplexing and demultiplexing
        FCAST Compound Objects.</t>

        <t>For a given Carousel Instance, one or more transmission cycles are
        possible. During each cycle, all of the Compound Objects comprising
        the carousel are sent. By default, each object is transmitted once per
        cycle. However, in order to allow different levels of priority, some
        objects MAY be transmitted more often than others during a cycle
        and/or benefit from higher FEC protection than others. For example,
        this can be the case for the CID objects (<xref target="cio"/>), where
        extra protection can benefit overall carousel integrity. For some
        FCAST usage (e.g., a unidirectional "push" mode), a Carousel Instance
        may be sent in a single transmission cycle. In other cases, it may be
        conveyed in a large number of transmission cycles (e.g., in
        "on-demand" mode, where objects are made available for download during
        a long period of time).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="cio"
               title="Carousel Instance Descriptor Special Object">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The FCAST sender can transmit an OPTIONAL CID. The CID carries
        the list of the Compound Objects
        that are part of a given Carousel Instance by specifying their
        respective Transport Object Identifiers (TOIs). However, the CID
        does not describe the objects themselves (i.e., there is no metadata).
        Additionally, the CID MAY include an "Fcast-CID-Complete: 1" metadata
        entry to indicate that no further modification to the enclosed list
        will be done in the future. Finally, the CID MAY include a Carousel
        Instance ID (CIID) that identifies the Carousel Instance it pertains
        to. These aspects are discussed in <xref
        target="carousel_instance_descr"/>.</t>

        <t>There is no reserved TOI value for the CID Compound Object itself,
        since this special object is regarded by ALC/LCT or NORM as a standard
        object. On the contrary, the nature of this object (CID) is indicated
        by means of a specific FCAST Header field (the "C" flag from
        <xref target="header_with_md_format"/>) so that it can be recognized
        and processed by the FCAST application as needed. A direct consequence
        is that since a receiver does not know in advance which TOI will
        be used for the following CID (in the case of a dynamic session), it
        MUST NOT filter out packets that are not in the current CID's TOI
        list. Said differently, the goal of the CID is not to set up ALC or
        NORM packet filters (this mechanism would not be secure in any
        case).</t>

        <t>The use of a CID remains OPTIONAL. If it is not used, then the
        clients progressively learn what files are part of the
        Carousel Instance by receiving ALC or NORM packets with new
        TOIs. However, using a CID has several benefits: <list style="symbols">
            <t>When an "Fcast-CID-Complete" metadata entry set to
            "Fcast-CID-Complete: 1" is included, the receivers know when they
            can leave the session, i.e., when they have received all the
            objects that are part of the last Carousel Instance of this
            delivery session.</t>

            <t>In the case of a session with a dynamic set of objects, the
            sender
            can reliably inform the receivers that some objects have been
            removed from the carousel with the CID. This solution is more
            robust than the Close Object "B" flag of ALC/LCT, since a client
            with intermittent connectivity might lose all the packets
            containing this "B" flag. And while NORM provides a robust object
            cancellation mechanism in the form of its NORM_CMD(SQUELCH)
            message in response to receiver NACK repair requests, the use of
            the CID provides an additional means for receivers to learn of
            objects for which it is futile to request repair.</t>

            <t>The TOI equivalence (<xref target="object_id"/>) is signaled
            within the CID.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>During idle periods, when the Carousel Instance does not contain
        any object, a CID with an empty TOI list MAY be transmitted. In that
        case, a new Carousel Instance ID MUST be used to differentiate this
        (empty) Carousel Instance from the other ones. This mechanism can be
        useful to inform the receivers that: <list style="symbols">
            <t>all the previously sent objects have been removed from the
            carousel. This therefore improves the robustness of FCAST 
            even during "idle" periods.</t>

            <t>the session is still active even if there is currently no
            content being sent. Said differently, it can be used as a
            heartbeat mechanism. If no "Fcast-CID-Complete" metadata entry is
            included (or if set to "Fcast-CID-Complete: 0"), it informs
            the receivers that the Carousel Instance may be modified and that
            new objects could be sent in the future.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="object_id" title="Compound Object Identification">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The FCAST Compound Objects are directly associated with the
        object-based transport service that the ALC and NORM protocols
        provide. In each protocol, the packets containing transport object
        content are labeled with a numeric transport object identifier: the
        TOI with ALC, and the NormTransportId with NORM. For the purposes of
        this document, this identifier in either case (ALC or NORM) is
        referred to as the TOI.</t>

        <t>There are several differences between ALC and NORM: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>ALC's use of the TOI is rather flexible, since several TOI field
            sizes are possible (from 16 to 112 bits); since this size can be
            changed at any time, on a per-packet basis; and since the 
            management of the TOI is totally free as long as each object is
            associated to a unique TOI (if no wraparound occurred).</t>

            <t>NORM's use of the TOI serves a more "directive" purpose,
            since the TOI field is
            16&nbsp;bits long and since TOIs MUST be managed sequentially.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In both NORM and ALC, it is possible that the transport
        identification space eventually wraps for long-lived sessions
        (especially with NORM, where this phenomenon is expected to happen more
        frequently). This can possibly introduce some ambiguity in FCAST
        object identification if a sender retains some older objects in newer
        Carousel Instances with updated object sets. To avoid ambiguity, the
        active TOIs (i.e., the TOIs corresponding to objects being
        transmitted) can only occupy half of the TOI sequence space. If an old
        object whose TOI has fallen outside the current window needs to be
        transmitted again, a new TOI must be used for it. In the case of NORM,
        this constraint limits to 32768 the maximum number of objects that can
        be part of any Carousel Instance.</t>

        <t>In order to allow receivers to properly combine the transport
        packets with a newly assigned TOI to those associated to the
        previously assigned TOI, a mechanism is required to equate the objects
        with the new and the old TOIs. This mechanism consists of signaling,
        within the CID, that the newly assigned TOI for the current Carousel
        Instance is equivalent to the TOI used within a previous Carousel
        Instance. By convention, the reference tuple for any object is the
        {TOI; CIID} tuple used for its first transmission within a Carousel
        Instance. This tuple MUST be used whenever a TOI equivalence is
        provided. <xref target="carousel_instance_descr"/> details how to
        describe these TOI equivalences.</t>

      <section anchor="sender_behavior" title="FCAST Sender Behavior">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>This section provides an informative description of expected FCAST
        sender behavior. The following operations can take place at a sender:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>The user (or another application) selects a set of objects
            (e.g., files) to deliver and submits them, along with their
            metadata, to the FCAST application.</t>

            <t>For each object, FCAST creates the Compound Object and
            registers it in the Carousel Instance.</t>

            <t>The user then informs FCAST that all the objects of the set
            have been submitted. If the user knows that no new object will be
            submitted in the future (i.e., if the session's content is now
            complete), the user informs FCAST. Finally, the user specifies how
            many transmission cycles are desired (this number may be
            infinite).</t>

            <t>At this point, the FCAST application knows the full list of
            Compound Objects that are part of the Carousel Instance and can
            create a CID if desired, possibly with "Fcast-CID-Complete: 1"
            if no new objects will be sent in the future.</t>

            <t>The FCAST application can now define a transmission schedule of
            these Compound Objects, including the optional CID. This schedule
            defines in which order the packets of the various Compound Objects
            should be sent. This document does not specify any scheme. This is
            left to the developer within the provisions of the underlying ALC
            or NORM protocol used and the knowledge of the target
            use-case.</t>

            <t>The FCAST application then starts the carousel transmission,
            for the number of cycles specified. Transmissions take place
            until: <list style="symbols">

        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>This section provides an informative description of expected FCAST
        receiver behavior. The following operations can take place at a
        receiver: <list style="numbers">
            <t>The receiver joins the session and collects incoming
            packets.</t>

            <t>If the header portion of a Compound Object is entirely received
            (which may happen before receiving the entire object with some
            ALC/NORM configurations), or if the metadata is sent by means of
            another mechanism prior to the object, the receiver processes the
            metadata and chooses whether or not to continue to receive the object
            content.</t>

            <t>When a Compound Object has been entirely received, the receiver
            processes the header, retrieves the object metadata, perhaps
            decodes the metadata, and processes the object accordingly.</t>

            <t>When a CID is received, as indicated by the "C" flag set
            in the FCAST Header, the receiver decodes the CID and retrieves
            the list of objects that are part of the current
            Carousel Instance. This list can be used to remove objects sent in
            a previous Carousel Instance that might not have been totally
            decoded and that are no longer part of the current
            Carousel Instance.</t>

            <t>When a CID is received, the receiver also retrieves the list of
            TOI equivalences, if any, and takes appropriate measures, for
            instance, by informing the transport layer.</t>

            <t>When a receiver receives a CID with an "Fcast-CID-Complete"
            metadata entry set to "Fcast-CID-Complete: 1" and has
            successfully received all the objects of the current
            Carousel Instance, it can safely exit from the current FCAST
            session.</t>

            <t>Otherwise, continue at Step 2 above.</t>

          <t>Modern cryptographic mechanisms can provide access control to
          transmitted objects. One way to do this is by encrypting the entire
          object prior to transmission, knowing that authenticated receivers
          have the cryptographic mechanisms to decrypt the content. Another
          way is to encrypt individual packets using IPsec/ESP <xref target="RFC4303"/>
          (see also <xref target="min-sec-recommendations"/>). These
          two techniques can also provide confidentiality to the objects being

        <section anchor="obj_corruption"
                 title="Attacks Meant to Corrupt Objects">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Protection against attacks on the data integrity of the object
          may be achieved by a mechanism agreed upon between the sender and
          receiver that features sender authentication and a method to verify
          that the object integrity has remained intact during transmission.
          This service can be provided at the object level, but in that case a
          receiver has no way to identify what symbols are corrupted if the
          object is detected as corrupted. This service can also be provided
          at the packet level. In some cases, after removing all corrupted
          packets, the object may be recovered. Several techniques can provide
          data integrity and sender authentication services: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>At the object level, the object can be digitally signed, for
              instance, by using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 <xref target="RFC3447"/>.
              This signature enables a receiver to check the object integrity.
              Even if digital signatures are computationally expensive, this
              calculation occurs only once per object, which is usually
              acceptable.</t>

              <t>At the packet level, each packet can be digitally signed
              <xref target="RFC6584"/>. A major limitation is the high
              computational and transmission overheads that this solution
              requires.</t>

              <t>At the packet level, a Group-keyed Message Authentication Code
              (MAC) <xref target="RFC2104"/> <xref target="RFC6584"/> scheme
              can be used, for instance, by using HMAC-SHA-256 with a secret
              key shared by all the group members, senders, and receivers.
 This
              technique creates a cryptographically secured digest of a packet
              that is sent along with the packet itself. The Group-keyed MAC scheme
              does not create prohibitive processing loads or transmission
              overhead, but it has a major limitation: it only provides a
              group authentication/integrity service, since all group members
              share the same secret group key; this means that each member
              can send a forged packet. It is therefore restricted to
              situations where group members are fully trusted, or in
              association with another technique as a preliminary check to
              quickly detect attacks initiated by non-group members and to
              discard their packets.</t>

              <t>At the packet level, Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant
              Authentication (TESLA) <xref target="RFC4082"/> <xref
              target="RFC5776"/> is an attractive solution that is robust to
              losses, provides an authentication and integrity verification
              service, and does not create any prohibitive processing load or
              transmission overhead. Yet, a delay is incurred in checking a
              TESLA authenticated packet; this delay may be more than what is
              desired in some use-cases.</t>

              <t>At the packet level, IPsec/ESP <xref target="RFC4303"/> can
              be used to check the integrity and authenticate the sender of
              all the packets being exchanged in a session (see <xref
              target="min-sec-recommendations"/>).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Techniques relying on public key cryptography (digital signatures
          and TESLA during the bootstrap process, when used) require that
          public keys be securely associated to the entities. This can be
          achieved via a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), a
          Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Web of Trust, or by securely preplacing 
          the public keys of each group member.</t>

          <t>Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography (Group-keyed MAC)
          require that a secret key be shared by all group members. This can
          be achieved by means of a group key management protocol or simply
          by securely preplacing the secret key (but this manual solution has
          many limitations).</t>

          <t>It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security
          requirements and features of the target application area, to define
          which solution is the most appropriate. In any case, whenever there
          is a threat of object corruption, it is RECOMMENDED that at least
          one of these techniques be used. <xref
          target="min-sec-recommendations"/> defines minimum security
          recommendations that can be used to provide such services.</t>

            multiple rate congestion control protocol.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The consequences of these attacks are potentially serious, since
        they can compromise the behavior of the content delivery system or
        even compromise the network itself.</t>

        <section anchor="attack_against_sdp"
                 title="Attacks against the Session Description">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>An FCAST receiver may potentially obtain an incorrect
          session description for the session. The consequence is that
          legitimate receivers with the wrong session description will be
          unable to correctly receive the session content or will
          inadvertently try to receive at a much higher rate than they
          are capable of, thereby possibly disrupting other traffic in the
          network.</t>

          <t>To avoid these problems, it is RECOMMENDED that measures be taken
          to prevent receivers from accepting incorrect session descriptions.
          One such measure is sender authentication to ensure that receivers
          only accept legitimate session descriptions from authorized senders.
          How these measures are achieved is outside the scope of this

          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Corrupting the FCAST CID is one way to create a DoS attack.
          For example, the attacker can insert an "Fcast-CID-Complete:&nbsp;1"
          metadata entry to make the receivers believe that no further
          modification will be done.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee

          either be applied at the packet level or globally over the whole CID

          <t>Modifying the object metadata is another way to launch an
          attack. For example, the attacker may change the message digest
          associated to an object, leading a receiver to reject an object
          even if it has been correctly received. More generally, a receiver
          SHOULD be very careful during metadata processing. For instance, a
          receiver SHOULD NOT try to follow links (e.g., the URI contained in
          the Content-Location metadata). As another example, malformed HTTP
          content can be used as an attack vector, and a receiver should take
          great care with such content.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee

                 title="Attacks against the Associated Building Blocks">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Let us first focus on the congestion control building block that
          may be used in an ALC or NORM session. A receiver with an incorrect
          or corrupted implementation of the multiple rate congestion control
          building block may affect the health of the network in the path
          between the sender and the receiver and may also affect the
          reception rates of other receivers who joined the session.</t>

          <t>When congestion control is applied with FCAST, it is therefore
          RECOMMENDED that receivers be authenticated as legitimate receivers
          before they can join the session. If authenticating a receiver does
          not prevent that receiver from launching an attack,
          the network operator will still be able to easily identify the
          receiver that launched the attack and take countermeasures.
          The details of how this is done are outside the scope of this
          document.</t>

          <t>When congestion control is applied with FCAST, it is also
          RECOMMENDED that a packet-level authentication scheme be used, as
          explained in <xref target="obj_corruption"/>. Some of them, like
          TESLA, only provide a delayed authentication service, whereas
          congestion control requires a rapid reaction. It is therefore
          RECOMMENDED <xref target="RFC5775"/> that a receiver using TESLA
          quickly reduce its subscription level when the receiver believes
          that congestion did occur, even if the packet has not yet been
          authenticated. Therefore, TESLA will not prevent DoS attacks where an
          attacker makes the receiver believe that congestion occurred. This
          is an issue for the receiver, but this will not compromise the
          network. Other authentication methods that do not feature this
          delayed authentication might be preferable, or a Group-keyed MAC
          scheme could be used in parallel with TESLA to prevent attacks
          launched from outside of the group.</t>

      <section title="Other Security Considerations">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>Lastly, we note that the security considerations that apply to, and
        are described in, ALC <xref target="RFC5775"/>, LCT <xref
        target="RFC5651"/>, NORM <xref target="RFC5740"/>, and FEC <xref
        target="RFC5052"/> also apply to FCAST, as FCAST builds on those
        specifications. In addition, any security considerations that apply to
        any congestion control building block used in conjunction with FCAST
        also apply to FCAST. Finally, the security discussion of <xref
        target="RMT-SEC"/> also applies here.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="min-sec-recommendations"
               title="Minimum Security Recommendations">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>We now introduce a security configuration that is mandatory to
        implement but not necessarily mandatory to use, in the sense
        of <xref target="RFC3365"/>.
        Since FCAST/ALC relies on ALC/LCT, it inherits the "baseline secure
        ALC operation" of <xref target="RFC5775"/>. Similarly, since
        FCAST/NORM relies on NORM, it inherits the "baseline secure NORM
        operation" of <xref target="RFC5740"/>. Therefore, IPsec/ESP in
        transport mode MUST be implemented, but not necessarily used, in
        accordance with <xref target="RFC5775"/> and <xref target="RFC5740"/>.
        <xref target="RFC4303"/> explains that ESP can be used to potentially
        provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, content
        integrity, anti-replay, and (limited) traffic flow confidentiality.
        <xref target="RFC5775"/> specifies that the data origin
        authentication, content integrity, and anti-replay services SHALL be
        used, and that the confidentiality service is RECOMMENDED. If a
        short-lived session MAY rely on manual keying, it is also RECOMMENDED
        that an automated key management scheme be used, especially in the case
        of long-lived sessions.</t>

        <t>Therefore, the RECOMMENDED solution for FCAST provides per-packet
        security, with data origin authentication, integrity verification, and
        anti-replay. This is sufficient to prevent most of the in-band attacks
        listed above. If confidentiality is required, a per-packet encryption
        SHOULD also be used.</t>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->

    <section anchor="op_considerations" title="Operational Considerations">
      <!-- ==================================== -->

      <t>FCAST is compatible with any congestion control protocol designed for
      ALC/LCT or NORM. However, depending on the use-case, the data flow
      generated by the FCAST application might not be constant but might
      instead be
      bursty in nature. Similarly, depending on the use-case, an FCAST session
      might be very short. Whether and how this will impact the congestion
      control protocol is out of the scope of the present document.</t>

      <t>FCAST is compatible with any security mechanism designed for ALC/LCT
      or NORM. The use of a security scheme is strongly RECOMMENDED (see <xref
      target="security"/>).</t>

      <t>FCAST is compatible with any FEC scheme designed for ALC/LCT or NORM.
      Whether FEC is used or not, and the kind of FEC scheme used, are to some
      extent transparent to FCAST.</t>

      <t>FCAST is compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6. Nothing in the FCAST
      specification has any implication on the source or destination IP
      address type.</t>

      <t>The delivery service provided by FCAST might be fully reliable, or
      only partially reliable, depending upon: <list style="symbols">
          <t>the way ALC or NORM is used (e.g., whether FEC encoding and/or
          NACK-based repair requests are used or not),</t>

          <t>the way the FCAST carousel is used (e.g., whether the objects are
          made available for a long time span or not), and</t>

          <t>the way in which FCAST itself is deployed (e.g., whether there is
          a session control application that might automatically extend an
          existing FCAST session until all receivers have received the
          transmitted content).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The receiver set can be restricted to a single receiver or possibly a
      very large number of receivers. While the choice of the underlying
      transport protocol (i.e., ALC or NORM) and its parameters may limit the
      practical receiver group size, nothing in FCAST itself limits it. For
      instance, if FCAST/ALC is used on top of purely unidirectional transport
      channels with no feedback information at all, which is the default mode
      of operation, then scalability is at a maximum, since neither FCAST,
      ALC, UDP, nor IP generates any feedback message. On the contrary, the
      scalability of FCAST/NORM is typically limited by the scalability of
      NORM itself.
      For example, NORM can be configured to operate using proactive FEC
      without feedback, similar to ALC, with receivers configured to provide
      NACK and, optionally, ACK feedback, or a hybrid combination of these.
      Similarly, if FCAST is used along with a session control application
      that collects reception information from the receivers, then this
      session control application may limit the scalability of the global
      object delivery system. This situation can of course be mitigated by
      using a hierarchy of servers or feedback message aggregation. The
      details of this are out of the scope of the present document.</t>

      <t>The content of a Carousel Instance MAY be described by means of an
      OPTIONAL CID (<xref target="cio"/>). The
      decision of whether the CID mechanism should be used or not is left to
      the sender. When it is used, the question of how often and when a
      CID should be sent is also left to the sender. These considerations
      depend on many parameters, including the target use-case and the
      session dynamics. For instance, it may be appropriate to send a CID
      at the beginning of each new Carousel Instance and then periodically.
      These operational aspects are out of the scope of the present document.</t>

        <t><xref target="expl_cid"/> shows an example CID object, in the case
        of a static FCAST session, i.e., a session where the set of objects is
        set once and for all. The metadata UTF-8 encoded text only contains
        the following entry, since Fcast-CID-ID is implicit:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[      Fcast-CID-Complete: 1<CR-LF>]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>This UTF-8 encoded text (since MDEnc=0) is 23 bytes long
        (there is no final '\0' character). Therefore, 1 padding byte is
        added.</t>

        <t>The Object List contains the following 25-byte-long string (there
        is no final '\0' character):</t>

        <t>There are therefore a total of 3+5+4+1 = 13 objects in the
        Carousel Instance and therefore in the FCAST session. There is no
        metadata associated to this CID. As the session is static and
        composed of a single Carousel Instance, the sender did not feel
        the necessity to carry a Carousel Instance ID metadata.</t>

      <section title="Supporting Additional Mechanisms">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>In certain use-cases, FCAST can take advantage of another in-band
        (e.g., via NORM_INFO messages (<xref target="norm_specifics"/>)) or
        out-of-band signaling mechanism. This section provides an overview of
        how other signaling mechanisms could be employed and a normative
        specification for how FCAST information is embedded when NORM_INFO
        messages are used for carrying FCAST Headers. Such additional
        signaling schemes can be used to carry the whole metadata, or a
        subset of it, ahead of time, before the associated Compound Object.
        Therefore, based on the information retrieved in this way, a
        receiver could decide in advance (i.e., before beginning the
        reception of the compound object) whether the object is of interest
        or not; this would mitigate the limitations of FCAST.
        While out-of-band techniques are
        out of the scope of this document, we explain below how this can be
        achieved in the case of FCAST/NORM.</t>

        <t>Supporting additional mechanisms is OPTIONAL in FCAST
        implementations. In any case, an FCAST sender MUST continue to send
        all the required metadata in the Compound Object, even if the whole
        metadata, or a subset of it, is sent by another mechanism (<xref
        target="compliance_requirements"/>). Additionally, when metadata is
        sent several times, there MUST NOT be any contradiction in the
        information provided by the different mechanisms. If a mismatch
        is detected, the metadata contained in the Compound Object MUST be
        used as the definitive source.</t>

        <t>When metadata elements are communicated out-of-band, in advance of
        data transmission, the following piece of information can be useful:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>TOI: a positive integer that contains the Transport Object
            Identifier (TOI) of the object, in order to enable a receiver to
            easily associate the metadata to the object. The valid range for
            TOI values is discussed in <xref target="object_id"/>.</t>
          </list></t>

      <section anchor="norm_specifics"
               title="Using NORM_INFO Messages with FCAST/NORM">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The NORM_INFO message of NORM can convey "out-of-band" content with
        respect to a given transport object. With FCAST, this message MAY be
        used as an additional mechanism to transmit metadata. In that case,
        the NORM_INFO message carries a new Compound Object that contains all
        the metadata of the original object, or a subset of it. The NORM_INFO
        Compound Object MUST NOT contain any Object Data field (i.e., it is
        only composed of the header), it MUST feature a non-global checksum,
        and it MUST NOT include a Padding field. Finally, note that the
        availability of NORM_INFO for a given
        object is signaled through the use of a dedicated flag in the
        NORM_DATA message header. Along with NORM's NACK-based repair request
        signaling, it allows a receiver to quickly (and independently) request
        an object's NORM_INFO content. However, a limitation here is that the
        FCAST Header MUST fit within the byte size limit defined by the NORM
        sender's configured "segment size" (typically a little less than the
        network MTU).</t>

        <section title="Example">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>In the case of FCAST/NORM, the object metadata (or a subset of
          it) can be carried as part of a NORM_INFO message, as a new Compound
          Object that does not contain any Object Data. In the following
          informative example, we assume that the whole metadata is carried in
          such a message. <xref target="expl_norm_info"/> shows an example
          NORM_INFO message that contains the FCAST Header, including
          metadata. In this example, the first 16 bytes are the NORM_INFO
          base header; the next 12 bytes are a NORM EXT_FTI header extension
          containing the FEC Object Transport Information for the associated
          object; and the remaining bytes are the FCAST Header, including
          metadata. Note that "padding" MUST NOT be used and that the FCAST
          checksum only encompasses the Compound Object Header (G=0).</t>

          <t>The NORM_INFO message shown in <xref target="expl_norm_info"/>
          contains the EXT_FTI header extension to carry the FEC OTI. In this
          example, the FEC OTI format is that of the Reed-Solomon FEC coding
          scheme for fec_id = 5, as described in <xref target="RFC5510"/>.
          Other alternatives for providing the FEC OTI would have been to
          either include it directly in the metadata of the FCAST Header or
          to include an EXT_FTI header extension to all NORM_DATA packets (or
          a subset of them). Note that the NORM "Transfer Length" is the total
          length of the associated Compound Object, i.e., 41 bytes.</t>

          <t>The Compound Object in this example does contain the same
          metadata and is formatted as in the example of <xref
          target="expl_object"/>. With the combination of the FEC_OTI and the
          FCAST metadata, the NORM protocol and FCAST application have all of
          the information needed to reliably receive and process the
          associated object. Indeed, the NORM protocol provides rapid
          (NORM_INFO has precedence over the associated object content),
          reliable delivery of the NORM_INFO message and its payload, the
          FCAST Compound Object.</t>
