    <abstract>

      <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a RESTful application
        protocol for constrained nodes and
        networks. The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over
        time. This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP that
        enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to
        retrieve a representation of a resource and keep this
        representation updated by the server over a period of time. The
        protocol follows a best-effort approach for sending new
        representations to clients and provides eventual consistency between
        the state observed by each client and the actual resource state at the
        server.</t>

      <section title="Background" anchor="background">

        <t>The <xref target="RFC7252">Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)</xref> is intended to
          provide <xref target="REST">RESTful services</xref> not unlike <xref
            target="RFC7230">HTTP</xref> while reducing the complexity of
          implementation as well as the size of packets exchanged in order to
          make these services useful in a highly constrained network of
          themselves highly constrained nodes <xref target="RFC7228"/>.</t>

        <t>The model of REST is that of a client exchanging representations of
          resources with a server, where a representation captures the current or
          intended state of a resource. The server is the authority for
          representations of the resources in its namespace. A client
          interested in the state of a resource initiates a request to the
          server; the server then returns a response with a representation of
          the resource that is current at the time of the request.</t>

        <t>This model does not work well when a client is interested in having
          a current representation of a resource over a period of time.
          Existing approaches from HTTP, such as repeated polling or <xref
            target="RFC6202">HTTP long polling</xref>, generate significant
          complexity and/or overhead and thus are less applicable in a
          constrained environment.</t>

        <t>The protocol specified in this document extends the CoAP core
          protocol with a mechanism for a CoAP client to "observe"
          a resource on a CoAP server: the client retrieves a representation
          of the resource and requests this representation be updated by the
          server as&nbsp;long as the client is interested in the resource.</t>

        <t>The protocol keeps the architectural properties of REST. It enables
          high scalability and efficiency through the support of caches and
          proxies. There is no intention, though, to solve the full set of problems
          that the existing HTTP solutions solve or to replace
          publish/subscribe networks that solve a much more general problem
            <xref target="RFC5989"/>.</t>

      <section title="Protocol Overview" anchor="overview">

        <t>The protocol is based on the well-known <xref target="GOF">observer
            design pattern</xref>. In this design pattern, components called
          "observers" register at a specific, known provider called
          the "subject" that they are interested in being notified
          whenever the subject undergoes a change in state. The subject is
          responsible for administering its list of registered observers. If
          multiple subjects are of interest to an observer, the observer must register
          separately for all of them.</t>

          registration request and the notifications are identified as such by
          the presence of the Observe Option defined in this document. In
          notifications, the Observe Option additionally provides a sequence number for
          reordering detection. All notifications carry the token specified by
          the client, so the client can easily correlate them to the request.</t>

        <t>A client remains on the list of observers as long as the
          server can determine the client's continued interest in the resource.
          The server may send a notification in a confirmable CoAP message to
          request an acknowledgement from the client. When the
          client deregisters, rejects a notification, or the transmission of a
          notification times out after several transmission attempts, the
          client is considered no longer interested in the resource and is removed by the server
          from the list of observers.</t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Consistency Model" anchor="consistency">
        
        <t>While a client is in the list of observers of a resource, the goal
          of the protocol is to keep the resource state observed by the client
          as closely in sync with the actual state at the server as
          possible.</t>

        <t>It cannot be avoided that the client and the server become
          out of sync at times: First, there is
          always some latency between the change of the resource state and the
          receipt of the notification. Second, CoAP messages with notifications can
          get lost, which will cause the client to assume an old state until it
          receives a new notification. And third, the server may erroneously
          come to the conclusion that the client is no longer interested in the
          resource, which will cause the server to stop sending notifications and the
          client to assume an old state until it eventually registers its interest
          again.</t>

        <t>The protocol addresses this issue as follows:<list style="symbols">
            <t>It follows a best-effort approach for sending the current
              representation to the client after a state change: clients should
              see the new state after a state change as soon as possible, and
              they should see as many states as possible. This is limited by
              congestion control, however, so a client
              cannot rely on observing every single state that a resource might
              go through.</t>
            <t>It labels notifications with a maximum duration up to which it
              is acceptable for the observed state and the actual state to be
              out of sync. When the age of the notification received reaches
              this limit, the client cannot use the enclosed representation
              until it receives a new notification.</t>
            <t>It is designed on the principle of eventual consistency: the
              protocol guarantees that if the resource does not undergo a new
              change in state, eventually all registered observers will have a
              current representation of the latest resource state.</t>
          </list></t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Observable Resources" anchor="resource-design">

        <t>A CoAP server is the authority for determining under what conditions
          resources change their state and thus when observers are notified of
          new resource states. The protocol does not offer explicit means for
          setting up triggers or thresholds; it is up to the server to expose
          observable resources that change their state in a way that is useful
          in the application context.</t>

        <t>For example, a CoAP server with an attached temperature sensor
            could expose one or more of the following resources:<list
              style="symbols">

            <t>&lt;coap://server/temperature&gt;,
              which changes its state every few seconds to a current reading
              of the temperature sensor;</t>

            <t>&lt;coap://server/temperature/felt&gt;,
              which changes its state to "COLD" whenever the temperature reading
              drops below a certain pre-configured threshold and to "WARM"
              whenever the reading exceeds a second, slightly higher threshold;</t>

            <t>&lt;coap://server/temperature/critical?above=42&gt;,
              which changes its state based on the client-specified parameter
              value either every few seconds to the current temperature reading if
              the temperature exceeds the threshold or to "OK" when the
              reading drops below;</t>

            <t>&lt;coap://server/?query=select+avg(temperature)+from+Sensor.window:<vspace/>time(30sec)&gt;,
              which accepts expressions of arbitrary complexity and changes
              its state accordingly.</t>

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Thus, by designing CoAP resources that change their state on certain
          conditions, it is possible to update the client only when these
          conditions occur instead of supplying it continuously with raw
          sensor data.
          By parameterizing resources, this is not limited to conditions
          defined by the server, but can be extended to arbitrarily complex
          queries specified by the client. The application designer therefore can
          choose exactly the right level of complexity for the application
          envisioned and devices involved and is not constrained to a "one size
          fits all" mechanism built into the protocol.</t>

    <section title="The Observe Option" anchor="option">

      <t>The Observe Option has the following properties. Its meaning
        depends on whether it is included in a GET request or in a response.</t>

        <postamble>C=Critical, U=Unsafe, N=No-Cache-Key, R=Repeatable</postamble>
      </texttable>
      
      <t>When included in a GET request, the Observe Option extends the GET
        method so it does not only retrieve a current representation of the
        target resource, but also requests the server to add or remove an
        entry in the list of observers of the resource depending on the
        option value. The list entry consists of the client endpoint and the
        token specified by the client in the request. Possible values are:
        <list>
          <t>0 (register) adds the entry to the list, if not present;</t>
          <t>1 (deregister) removes the entry from the list, if present.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The Observe Option is not critical for processing the request. If
        the server is unwilling or unable to add a new entry to the list of
        observers, then the request falls back to a normal GET request and
        the response does not include the Observe Option.</t>
      
<!-- [rfced] FYI, "cache-key" has been capitalized "Cache-Key"
to match how it appears in RFC 7252. Please let us know if 
you prefer otherwise. -->

      <t>The Observe Option is not part of the Cache-Key: a cacheable
        response obtained with an Observe Option in the request can be used to
        satisfy a request without an Observe Option, and vice versa. When a
        stored response with an Observe Option is used to satisfy a normal GET
        request, the option MUST be removed before the response is returned.</t>

      <t>When included in a response, the Observe Option identifies the message as a
        notification. This implies that a matching entry exists in the list of observers and
        that the server will notify the client of changes to the resource state.
        The option value is a sequence number for reordering detection
        (see Sections <xref target="client-reordering" format="counter"/> and <xref
          target="server-reordering" format="counter"/>).</t>
          
      <t>The value of the Observe Option is encoded as an unsigned integer in
        network byte order using a variable number of bytes ('uint' option
        format); see <xref target="RFC7252">Section 3.2 of RFC 7252</xref>.</t>

        <t>A client registers its interest in a resource by issuing a GET
          request with an Observe Option set to 0 (register). If the server
          returns a 2.xx response that includes an Observe Option as well,
          the server has successfully added an entry with the client endpoint
          and request token to the list of observers of the target resource, and
          the client will be notified of changes to the resource state.</t>

        <t>Like a fresh response can be used to satisfy a request without
          contacting the server, the stream of updates resulting from one
          observation request can be used to satisfy another (observation

          A client MUST aggregate such requests and MUST
          NOT register more than once for the same target resource. The target
          resource is identified by all options in the request that are part
          of the Cache-Key. This includes, for example, the full request URI
          and the Accept Option.</t>

      <section title="Notifications" anchor="client-notifications">

        <t>Notifications are additional responses sent by the server in reply
          to the single extended GET request that created the registration.
          Each notification includes the token specified by the client in the
          request. The only difference between a notification and a normal
          response is the presence of the Observe Option.</t>
        
        <t>Notifications typically have a 2.05 (Content) response code. They
          include an Observe Option with a sequence number for reordering
          detection (see <xref target="client-reordering"/>) and a payload
          in the same Content-Format as the initial response. If the client
          included one or more ETag Options in the GET request (see <xref
            target="client-caching"/>), notifications can have a 2.03
          (Valid) response code rather than a 2.05 (Content) response code.
          Such notifications include an Observe Option with a sequence
          number but no payload.</t>
        
        <t>In the event that the resource changes in a way that would cause
          a normal GET request at that time to return a non-2.xx response
          (for example, when the resource is deleted), the server sends a
          notification with an appropriate response code (such as 4.04 Not
          Found) and removes the client's entry from the list of observers of the
          resource. Non-2.xx responses do not include an Observe Option.</t>

      <section title="Caching" anchor="client-caching">

        <t>As notifications are just additional responses to a GET request,
          notifications partake in caching as defined in <xref
            target="RFC7252">Section 5.6 of RFC 7252</xref>. Both
          the freshness model and the validation model are supported.</t>

        <section title="Freshness" anchor="client-freshness">

          <t>A client MAY store a notification like a response in its cache and
            use a stored notification that is fresh without contacting the
            server. Like a response, a notification is considered fresh while
            its age is not greater than the value indicated by the Max-Age
            Option (and no newer notification/response has been received).</t>

          <t>The server will do its best to keep the resource state observed by
            the client as closely in sync with the actual state as possible.
            However, a client cannot rely on observing every single state that
            a resource might go through. For example, if the network is
            congested or the state changes more frequently than the network can
            handle, the server can skip notifications for any number of intermediate
            states.</t>

          <t>The server uses the Max-Age Option to indicate an age up to which
            it is acceptable that the observed state and the actual state are
            inconsistent. If the age of the latest notification becomes greater
            than its indicated Max-Age, then the client MUST NOT assume that
            the enclosed representation reflects the actual resource state.</t>
          
          <t>To make sure it has a current representation and/or to re-register
            its interest in a resource, a client MAY issue a new GET request
            with the same token as the original at any time. All options MUST
            be identical to those in the original request except for the set
            of ETag Options. It is RECOMMENDED that the client does not issue
            the request while it still has a fresh notification/response for the
            resource in its cache. Additionally, the client SHOULD at least wait
            for a random amount of time between 5&nbsp;and&nbsp;15 seconds after
            Max-Age expired to reduce collisions with other clients.</t>

        <section title="Validation" anchor="client-validation">

          <t>When a client has one or more notifications stored in its cache
            for a resource, it can use the ETag Option in the GET request to
            give the server an opportunity to select a stored notification to
            be used.</t>

          <t>The client MAY include an ETag Option for each stored response
            that is applicable in the GET request. Whenever the observed
            resource changes to a representation identified by one of the ETag
            Options, the server can select a stored response by sending a 2.03
            (Valid) notification with an appropriate ETag Option instead of a
            2.05 (Content) notification.</t>
            
          <t>A client implementation needs to keep all candidate responses in
            its cache until it is no longer interested in the target resource
            or it re-registers with a new set of entity tags.</t>

        <t>Messages with notifications can arrive in a different order than
          they were sent. Since the goal is to keep the observed state as

          consider the notification that was sent most recently as the
          freshest, regardless of the order of arrival.</t>

        <t>To provide an order among notifications for the client, the server
          sets the value of the Observe Option in each notification to
          the 24 least significant bits of a strictly increasing sequence

              time the resource undergoes a change of state (provided that the
              resource changes its state less than 2^23 times in the first 256

              1 kHz (most CoAP applications will be several orders of magnitude

        <t>A notification can be sent in a confirmable or a non-confirmable

        <t>For example, for resources that change in a somewhat predictable or
          regular fashion, notifications can be sent in non-confirmable
          messages; for resources that change infrequently, notifications can
          be sent in confirmable messages. The server can combine these two
          approaches depending on the frequency of state changes and the
          importance of individual notifications.</t>
        
        <t>A server MAY choose to skip sending a notification if it knows that
          it will send another notification soon, for example, when the state of a resource is
          changing frequently. It also MAY choose to send more than one notification
          for the same resource state. However, above all, the server MUST ensure that a
          client in the list of observers of a resource eventually observes the
          latest state if the resource does not undergo a new change in state.</t>
        
        <t>For example, when state changes occur in bursts, the server can skip
          some notifications, send the notifications in non-confirmable messages,
          and make sure that the client observes the latest state change by
          repeating the last notification in a confirmable message when the
          burst is over.</t>

        <t>The client's acknowledgement of a confirmable notification signals
          that the client is interested in receiving further
          notifications. If a client rejects a confirmable or non-confirmable
          notification with a Reset message, or if the last attempt to
          retransmit a confirmable notification times out, then the client is
          considered no longer interested and the server MUST remove the
          associated entry from the list of observers.<list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Implementation Note:">To properly process a Reset

              it sends. This may be challenging for a server with constrained
              resources. 

   However, since Reset messages are transmitted unreliably, the
client must be prepared in case the Reset messages are not received by the server.
   Thus, a server can always pretend that a Reset
              message rejecting a non-confirmable notification was lost. If a
              server does this, it could accelerate cancellation by

            4.7 of RFC 7252</xref>. However, CoAP places the responsibility of
          congestion control for simple request/response interactions only
          on the clients: rate-limiting request transmission implicitly controls
          the transmission of the responses. When a single request yields a
          potentially infinite number of notifications, additional
          responsibility needs to be placed on the server.</t>

        <t>In order not to cause congestion, servers MUST strictly limit the
          number of simultaneous outstanding notifications/responses that they
          transmit to a given client to NSTART (1 by default; see <xref
            target="RFC7252">Section 4.7 of RFC 7252</xref>). An outstanding
          notification/response is either a confirmable message for which an
          acknowledgement has not yet been received and whose last retransmission
          attempt has not yet timed out or a non-confirmable message for which
          the waiting time that results from the following rate-limiting rules
          has not yet elapsed.</t>

        <t>The server SHOULD NOT send more than one non-confirmable
          notification per round-trip time (RTT) to a client on average.
          If the server cannot maintain an RTT estimate for a client, it
          SHOULD NOT send more than one non-confirmable notification every
          3&nbsp;seconds and SHOULD use an even less aggressive rate when
          possible (see also <xref target="RFC5405">Section 3.1.2 of RFC
            5405</xref>).</t>
        
        <t>Further congestion control optimizations and considerations are
          expected in the future with advanced CoAP congestion control
          mechanisms.</t>

      <section title="Advanced Transmission" anchor="server-advanced">

        <t>The state of an observed resource may change while the number of
   simultaneous outstanding notifications/responses to
          a client on the list of observers is greater than or equal to NSTART.
          In this case, the server cannot notify the client of the new resource
          state immediately but has to wait for an outstanding notification/response
          to complete first.</t>
        
        <t>If there exists an outstanding notification/response that the server
          transmits to the client and that pertains to the changed
          resource, then it is desirable for the server to stop working towards
          getting the representation of the old resource state to the client
          and to start transmitting the current representation to the client instead,
          so the resource state observed by the client stays closer in sync
          with the actual state at the server.</t>
        
        <t>For this purpose, the server MAY optimize the transmission process
          by aborting the transmission of the old notification (but not before
          the current transmission attempt is completed) and starting a new transmission
          for the new notification (but with the retransmission timer and counter of the aborted
          transmission retained).</t>
        
        <t>In more detail, a server MAY supersede an outstanding transmission that
          pertains to an observation as follows:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Wait for the current (re)transmission attempt to be acknowledged,
              rejected, or to time out (confirmable transmission); or, wait for
              the waiting time to elapse or the transmission to be rejected
              (non-confirmable transmission).</t>
            <t>If the transmission is rejected or it was the
              last attempt to retransmit a notification, remove the associated
              entry from the list of observers of the observed resource.</t>
            <t>If the entry is still in the list of observers, start to
              transmit a new notification with a representation of the
              current resource state. Should the resource have changed its
              state more than once in the meantime, the notifications for
              the intermediate states are silently skipped.</t>
            <t>The new notification is transmitted with a new Message ID and
              the following transmission parameters: if the previous
              (re)transmission attempt timed out, retain its transmission
              parameters, increment the retransmission counter, and double
              the timeout; otherwise, initialize the transmission parameters
              as usual (see
              <xref target="RFC7252">Section 4.2 of RFC 7252</xref>).</t>
          </list>
          It is possible that the server later receives an acknowledgement
          for a confirmable notification that it superseded this way. Even
          though this does not signal consistency, it is valuable in that
          it signals the client's further interest in the resource. The server
          therefore should avoid inadvertently removing the associated entry
          from the list of observers.</t>

    <section title="Intermediaries" anchor="intermediary">

      <t>A client may be interested in a resource in the namespace of a
        server that is reached through a chain of one or more CoAP
        intermediaries. In this case, the client registers its interest with
        the first intermediary towards the server, acting as if it was
        communicating with the server itself, as specified in <xref
          target="client"/>. It is the task of this intermediary to provide the
        client with a current representation of the target resource and to keep
        the representation updated upon changes to the resource state, as
        specified in <xref target="server"/>.</t>

      <t>To perform this task, the intermediary SHOULD make use of the protocol
        specified in this document, taking the role of the client and
        registering its own interest in the target resource with the next hop
        towards the server. If the response returned by the next hop
        doesn't include an Observe Option, the intermediary MAY resort to
        polling the next hop or MAY itself return a response without
        an Observe Option.</t>
      
      <t>The communication between each pair of hops is independent; each hop
        in the server role MUST determine individually how many notifications
        to send, of which message type, and so on. Each hop MUST generate its
        own values for the Observe Option in notifications and MUST set the value of the
        Max-Age Option according to the age of the local current
        representation.</t>

      <t>If two or more clients have registered their interest in a resource
        with an intermediary, the intermediary MUST register itself only
        once with the next hop and fan out the notifications it receives to
        all registered clients. This relieves the next hop from sending the
        same notifications multiple times and thus enables scalability.</t>

      <t>An intermediary is not required to act on behalf of a client to
        observe a resource; an intermediary MAY observe a resource, for
        example, just to keep its own cache up to date.</t>

      <t>The "obs" attribute, when present, is a hint indicating that the
        destination of a link is useful for observation and thus, for example,
        should have a suitable graphical representation in a user interface.
        Note that this is only a hint; it is not a promise that the Observe
        Option can actually be used to perform the observation. A client may
        need to resort to polling the resource if the Observe Option is not
        returned in the response to the GET request.</t>

      <t>A value MUST NOT be given for the "obs" attribute; any present value
        MUST be ignored by parsers. The "obs" attribute MUST NOT appear more

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">

      <t>The security considerations in Section 11 of <xref
      target="RFC7252"/>, the CoAP specification, apply.</t>

      <t>Observing resources can dramatically increase the negative effects of
        amplification attacks. That is, not only can notifications messages be
        much larger than the request message, but the nature of the protocol
        can cause a significant number of notifications to be generated.
        Without client authentication, a server therefore MUST
        strictly limit the number of notifications that it sends
        between receiving acknowledgements that confirm the actual interest of
        the client in the data; i.e., any notifications sent in non-confirmable
        messages MUST be interspersed with confirmable messages. Note that an attacker
        may still spoof the acknowledgements if the confirmable messages are
        sufficiently predictable.</t>
      
      <t>The protocol follows a best-effort approach for keeping the state
        observed by a client and the actual resource state at a server in sync.
        This may have the client and the server become out of sync at times.
        Depending on the sensitivity of the observed resource, operating on
        an old state might be a security threat. The client therefore must
        be careful not to use a representation after its Max-Age expires, and
        the server must set the Max-Age Option to a sensible value.</t>

      <t>As with any protocol that creates state, attackers may attempt to
        exhaust the resources that the server has available for maintaining the
        list of observers for each resource. Servers may want to apply access controls
        to this creation of state. As degraded behavior, the server can always
        fall back to processing the request as a normal GET request (without
        an Observe Option) if it is unwilling or unable to add a client to the
        list of observers of a resource, including if system resources are
        exhausted or nearing exhaustion.</t>

      <t>Intermediaries must be careful to ensure that notifications cannot be
        employed to create a loop. A simple way to break any loops is to employ
        caches for forwarding notifications in intermediaries.</t>

      <t>Resources can be observed over CoAP that is secured by Datagram
      Transport Layer Security (DTLS) using any of the
        security modes described in Section 9 of RFC 7252. The use of DTLS
        is indicated by the "coaps" URI scheme. All notifications resulting from
        a GET request with an Observe Option MUST be returned within the same
        epoch of the same connection as the request.</t>
