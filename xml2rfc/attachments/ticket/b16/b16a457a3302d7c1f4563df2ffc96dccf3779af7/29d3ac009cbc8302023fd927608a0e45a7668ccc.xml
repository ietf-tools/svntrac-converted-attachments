       <t hangText="ROA:">Route Origin Authorization (ROA) is an RPKI object signed by a prefix holder authorizing origination of said prefix from an origin AS specified in said ROA.</t> 
       <t hangText="AS 0 ROA:">A ROA with ASN value 0 (zero) in the AS ID field. AS 0 ROA is an attestation by
   a prefix holder that the prefix described in the ROA, and any more
   specific prefix, should not be used in a routing context <xref target="RFC6483"></xref>.</t> 
       <t hangText="ROA prefix:">The prefix from a ROA. </t>

<t>
the rightmost AS in the final segment of the AS_PATH attribute in the route if that segment is of type AS_SEQUENCE, or 
</t>
<t>
the BGP speaker's own AS number if that segment is of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET or if the AS_PATH is empty, or 
</t>
<t>
the distinguished value "NONE" if the final segment of the AS_PATH attribute is of any other type.
</t> 
</list> 
</t>
  
<t hangText="Covering ROA prefix:">A ROA prefix that is an exact match or a
less specific when compared to the route prefix under consideration. In other
words, the route prefix is said to have a covering ROA prefix when there exists
a ROA such that the ROA prefix length is less than or equal to the route prefix
length and the ROA prefix address matches the route prefix address for
all bits specified by the ROA prefix length. </t>
<t hangText="Covering ROA:">If a ROA contains a covering ROA prefix for a route
prefix under consideration, then the ROA is said to be a covering ROA for the
route prefix. </t>

<t hangText="No covering ROA:">No covering ROA exists for a route prefix under consideration.</t>

<t hangText="Matched:">A route's {prefix, origin AS} pair is said to be matched
by a ROA when the route prefix has a covering ROA, and in addition, the route
prefix length is less than or equal to the maxLength in said covering ROA and
the route origin ASN is equal to the ASN in said covering ROA.</t>

<t>Given these definitions, any given BGP route will be found to have
   one of the following "validation states":
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>
NotFound: The route prefix has no covering ROA.
</t>
<t>
Valid: The route's {prefix, origin AS} pair is matched by at least one ROA.

<t>
Invalid: The route prefix has at least one covering ROA and the route's {prefix, origin AS} pair is not matched by any ROA.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   It is to be noted that no ROA can have the value "NONE" as its ROA
ASN. Thus, a route whose origin ASN is "NONE" cannot be matched by any ROA.
   Similarly, no valid route can have an origin ASN of zero <xref target="AS0-PROC"></xref>. Thus, no route can be matched by a ROA whose ASN is zero (i.e., an AS 0 ROA) <xref target="RFC6483"></xref>.

        <section title="Overview">
                <section anchor="overview" title="General Interpretation of RPKI Object Semantics">
                        <t>In the interpretation of relying parties (RPs), or relying party 
                                routing software, it is important that a 'make before break' operational policy be applied. In part, this means that an RP should 
                                implement a routing decision process where a route is assumed to be intended (i.e., considered unsuspicious) unless 
                                proven otherwise by the existence of a valid RPKI object that explicitly invalidates the route (see <xref target="preval"></xref> for examples). 
Also, especially in cases when a prefix is newly acquired by allocation/sub-allocation or due to 
prefix-ownership transfer, a ROA should be registered in RPKI prior to advertisement
of the prefix in BGP. This is highly recommended for the following
reasons. Observe that in the transfer case (considering a prefix transfer from
Org A  to Org B), even though Org A's resource cert would be revoked before
issuing a resource cert to Org B, there may be some latency before all relying
parties discard the previously received ROA of Org A for that prefix. The
latency may be due to CRL propagation delay in the RPKI system or due to
periodic polling by RPs, etc. Also, observe that in the sub-allocation case
(from parent Org A to child Org B), there may be an existing ROA registered by
Org A (with their own origin ASN) for a covering aggregate prefix relative to
the prefix in consideration. If the new prefix owner (Org B) has not already
registered their own ROA (i.e., ROA with their origin ASN), then the presence
of a different covering ROA (i.e., one with a different origin ASN) belonging
to Org A would result in invalid assessment for the route advertised by the new
owner (Org B). Thus, in both cases (transfer or sub-allocation), it is prudent
for the new owner (Org B) to ensure that its route for the prefix will be valid
by proactively issuing a ROA before advertising the route. The ROA should be
issued with sufficient lead time taking into consideration the RPKI propagation
delays.
</t>
<t>
As stated earlier in <xref target="definition"></xref>, for all of the use
cases in this document, it is assumed that RPKI objects (e.g., resource
certificates, ROAs) validate in accordance with <xref target="RFC6487"></xref>
and <xref target="RFC6480"></xref>. In other words, we assume that corrupted
RPKI objects, if any, have been detected and eliminated.</t>
                        
                        <t>While many of the examples provided here illustrate organizations using their own autonomous system numbers to originate routes, it should be recognized that a prefix holder need not necessarily be the holder of the autonomous system number used for the route origination.</t>

should be easy to deduce what new ROAs need to be created and what existing
ROAs need to be maintained (or revoked). The resource transfer 
                        and timing of revocation/creation of the ROAs need to be performed based on the make-before-break principle 
                        and using suitable Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
 procedures (see <xref target="overview"></xref>).

<t>These use cases try to systematically enumerate the situations a relying party may encounter while receiving a 
        BGP update and making use of ROA information to interpret the validity of the prefix-origin information in the routes derived from 
        the update. We enumerate the situations or scenarios and include a recommendation for the expected outcome of prefix-origin validation.
        For a description of prefix-origin validation algorithms, see <xref target="RFC6483"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6811"></xref>. We use the terms Valid, Invalid, and NotFound as defined in <xref target="RFC6811"></xref> and summarized earlier in <xref target="definition"></xref>.
Also see <xref target="RFC6472"></xref> for work in progress in the IDR WG to
deprecate AS_SETs in BGP updates. The use cases described here can be
potentially used as test cases for testing and evaluation of prefix-origin
validation in router implementations; see, for example, <xref
