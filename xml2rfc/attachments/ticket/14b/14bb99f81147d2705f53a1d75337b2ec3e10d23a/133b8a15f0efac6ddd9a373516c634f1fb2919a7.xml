      <t>This document presents thoughts on the potential impact of
      supporting HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) technologies in Content
      Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) scenarios. The intent is
      to present the authors' analysis of the CDNI-HAS problem space and
      discuss different options put forward by the authors (and by others
      during informal discussions) on how to deal with HAS in the context
      of CDNI. This document has been used as input information during the
      CDNI working group process for making a decision regarding support
      for HAS.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC6707"/> defines the problem space for
      Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) and the
      associated CDNI interfaces. This includes support, through
      interconnected Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), of content
      delivery to End Users using HTTP progressive download and
      HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS).</t>

      <t>HTTP Adaptive Streaming is an umbrella term for various HTTP-based
      streaming technologies that allow a client to adaptively switch between
      multiple bitrates, depending on current network conditions. A defining
      aspect of HAS is that, since it is based on HTTP, it is a pull-based
      mechanism, with a client actively requesting content segments instead
      of the content being pushed to the client by a server. Due to this
      pull-based nature, media servers delivering content using HAS often show
      different characteristics when compared with media servers delivering
      content using traditional streaming methods such as the
      Real-time Transport Protocol / Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTP/RTSP),
      the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), and the
      Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS).</t>

      <t>This document presents a discussion of the impact of the HAS
      operation on the CDNI interfaces, and what HAS-specific
      optimizations may be required or may be desirable. The
      scope of this document is to present the authors' analysis of the
      CDNI-HAS problem space and discuss different options put forward by
      the authors (and by others during informal discussions) on how to deal
      with HAS in the context of CDNI. The document concludes by presenting
      the authors' recommendations on how the CDNI WG should deal with HAS in
      its initial charter, with a focus on 'making it work' instead of
      including 'nice-to-have' optimizations that might delay the development
      of the CDNI WG deliverables identified in its initial charter.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that the document is not a WG document but has
      been used as input during the WG process for making its
      decision regarding support for HAS. We expect the analysis presented in
      the document to be useful in the future if and when the WG
      recharters and wants to reassess the level of HAS optimizations to be
      supported in CDNI scenarios.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This document uses the terminology defined in <xref
        target="RFC6707"/> and <xref target="CDNI-FRAMEWORK"/>.</t>

        <t>For convenience, the definitions of HAS-related terms are restated
        here:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Content Item:">A uniquely addressable content element in a
        CDN. A content item is defined by the fact that it has its own Content
        Metadata associated with it. An example of a content item is a video
        file/stream, an audio file/stream, or an image file.</t>

        <t hangText="Chunk:">A fixed-length element that is the result of a
        segmentation or fragmentation operation and that is independently
        addressable.</t>

        <t hangText="Fragment:">A specific form of chunk (see <xref
        target="segVfrag"/>).
        A fragment is stored as part of a larger file that includes all chunks
        that are part of the chunk collection.</t>

        <t hangText="Segment:">A specific form of chunk (see <xref
        target="segVfrag"/>). A segment is stored as a single file from a
        file-system perspective.</t>

        <t hangText="Original Content:">Non-chunked content that is the basis
        for a segmentation or fragmentation operation. Based on Original
        Content, multiple alternative representations (using different encoding
        methods, supporting different resolutions, and/or targeting different
        bitrates) may be derived, each of which may be fragmented or
        segmented.</t>

        <t hangText="Chunk Collection:">The set of all chunks that are the
        result of a single segmentation or fragmentation operation being
        performed on a single representation of the Original Content.
        A chunk collection is described in a Manifest File.</t>

        <t hangText="Content Collection:">The set of all chunk collections
        that are derived from the same Original Content. A content collection
        may consist of multiple chunk collections, each corresponding to a
        single representation of the Original Content. A content collection
        may be described by one or more Manifest Files.</t>

        <t hangText="Manifest File:">A Manifest File, also referred to as a
        Media Presentation Description (MPD) file, is a file that lists the
        way the content has been chunked (possibly for multiple encodings),
        as well as where the various chunks are located (in the case of
        segments) or how they can be addressed (in the case of fragments).</t>

    <section title="HTTP Adaptive Streaming Aspects Relevant to CDNI">
      <t>In the last couple of years, a wide variety of HAS-like protocols
      have emerged. Among them are proprietary solutions such as Apple's HTTP
      Live Streaming (HLS), Microsoft's HTTP Smooth Streaming (HSS), and
      Adobe's HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS), as well as various standardized
      solutions such as 3GPP Adaptive HTTP Streaming (AHS) and
      MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). While all of these
      technologies share a common set of features, each has its own defining
      elements. This section looks at some of the common characteristics
      and some of the differences between these technologies and how those
      might be relevant to CDNI. In particular, <xref target="segVfrag"/> 
      describes the various methods to store HAS content, and <xref
      target="addressing"/>
      lists three methods that are used to address HAS content in a CDN.
      After these generic HAS aspects are discussed, two special situations
      that need to be taken into account when discussing HAS are addressed:
      <xref target="livevod"/> discusses the differences between live content
      and Video on Demand (VoD) content, while <xref target="splicing"/>
      discusses the scenario where multiple streams are combined in a single
      Manifest File (e.g., for ad insertion purposes).</t>

      <section anchor="segVfrag" title="Segmentation versus Fragmentation">
        <t>All HAS implementations are based on a concept referred to as
        "chunking": the concept of having a server split content up in numerous
        fixed-duration chunks that are independently decodable. By
        sequentially requesting and receiving chunks, a client can recreate
        and play out the content. An advantage of this mechanism is that it
        allows a client to seamlessly switch between different encodings of
        the same Original Content at chunk boundaries. Before requesting a
        particular chunk, a client can choose between multiple alternative
        encodings of the same chunk, irrespective of the encoding of the
        chunks it has requested earlier.</t>

        <t>While every HAS implementation uses some form of chunking, not all
        implementations store the resulting chunks in the same way. In
        general, there are two distinct methods of performing chunking and
        storing the results: segmentation and fragmentation.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="-">With segmentation -- which is, for example,
            mandatory in all versions of Apple's HLS prior to version 7 --
            the chunks, in this case also referred to as segments, are
            stored completely independently from each other, with each segment
            being stored as a separate file from a file-system perspective.
            This means that each segment has its own unique URL with which it
            can be retrieved.</t>

            <t hangText="-">With fragmentation (or virtual segmentation) --
            which is, for example, used in Microsoft's HTTP Smooth Streaming
            -- all chunks, or fragments, belonging to the same
            chunk collection are
            stored together as part of a single file. While there are a
            number of container formats that allow for storing this type of
            chunked content, fragmented MP4 is most commonly used. With
            fragmentation, a specific chunk is addressable by suffixing, to
            the common file URL, an identifier uniquely identifying the chunk
            that one is interested in, either by timestamp, by byte range, or
            in some other way.</t>
          </list>While one can argue about the merits of each of these two
        different methods of handling chunks, both have their advantages and
        drawbacks in a CDN environment. For example, fragmentation is often
        regarded as a method that introduces less overhead, from both a
        storage and processing perspective. Segmentation, on the other hand, is
        regarded as being more flexible and easier to cache. In practice,
        current HAS implementations increasingly support both methods.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="addressing" title="Addressing Chunks">
        <t>In order for a client to request chunks, in the form of either
        segments or fragments, it needs to know how the content
        has been chunked and where to find the chunks. For this purpose, most
        HAS protocols use a concept that is often referred to as a Manifest
        File (also known as a Media Presentation Description, or MPD), i.e., a
        file that lists the way the content has been chunked and where the
        various chunks are located (in the case of segments) or how they can
        be addressed (in the case of fragments). A Manifest File or set of
        Manifest Files may also identify the different representations, and
        thus chunk collections, available for the content.</t>

        <t>In general, a HAS client will first request and receive a Manifest
        File, and then, after parsing the information in the Manifest File,
        proceed with sequentially requesting the chunks listed in the Manifest
        File. Each HAS implementation has its own Manifest File format, and
        even within a particular format there are different methods available
        to specify the location of a chunk.</t>

        <t>Of course, managing the location of files is a core aspect of every
        CDN, and each CDN will have its own method of doing so. Some CDNs may
        be purely cache-based, with no higher-level knowledge of where each
        file resides at each instant in time. Other CDNs may have dedicated
        management nodes that, at each instant in time, do know at which
        servers each file resides. The CDNI interfaces designed by the CDNI WG
        will probably need to be agnostic to these kinds of CDN- internal
        architecture decisions. In the case of HAS, there is a strict
        relationship between the location of the content in the CDN (in this
        case chunks) and the content itself (the locations specified in the
        Manifest File). It is therefore useful to have an understanding of the
        different methods in use in CDNs today for specifying chunk locations
        in Manifest Files. The different methods for doing so are described in
        Sections <xref target="relative_url" format="counter"/> to
        <xref target="absolute_without" format="counter"/>.</t>

        <t>Although these sections are especially relevant for segmented
        content due to its inherent distributed nature, the discussed methods
        are also applicable to fragmented content. Furthermore, it should be
        noted that the methods detailed below for specifying locations of
        content items in Manifest Files do not relate only to temporally
        segmented content (e.g., segments and fragments) but are also relevant
        in situations where content is made available in multiple
        representations (e.g., in different qualities, encoding methods,
        resolutions, and/or bitrates). In this case, the content consists of
        multiple chunk collections, which may be described by either a single
        Manifest File or multiple interrelated Manifest Files. In the latter
        case, there may be a high-level Manifest File describing the various
        available bitrates, with URLs pointing to separate Manifest Files
        describing the details of each specific bitrate. For specifying the
        locations of the other Manifest Files, the same methods that are
        used for specifying chunk locations also apply.</t>

        <t>One final note relates to the delivery of the Manifest Files
        themselves. While in most situations the delivery of both the Manifest
        File and the chunks is handled by the CDN, there are scenarios
        imaginable in which the Manifest File is delivered by, for example,
        the Content Service Provider (CSP), and the Manifest File is
        therefore not visible to the CDN.</t>

        <section anchor="relative_url" title="Relative URLs">
          <t>One method for specifying chunk locations in a Manifest File is
          through the use of relative URLs. A relative URL is a URL that does
          not include the HOST part of a URL but only includes (part of) the
          PATH part of a URL. In practice, a relative URL is used by the
          client as being relative to the location from which the
          Manifest File has been acquired. In these cases, a relative URL will
          take the form of a string that has to be appended to the location
          of the Manifest File to get the location of a specific chunk.
          This means that in the case where a Manifest File with
          relative URLs is used, all chunks will be delivered by the same
          Surrogate that delivered the Manifest File. A relative URL will
          therefore not include a hostname.</t>

          <t>For example, in the case where a Manifest File has been
          requested (and received) from:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t>http://surrogate.server.cdn.example.com/content_1/manifest.xml</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>a relative URL pointing to a specific segment referenced in the
          Manifest File might be:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t>segments/segment1_1.ts</t>
            </list>which means that the client should take the location of the
          Manifest File and append the relative URL. In this case, the segment
          would then be requested from
          <eref target="http://surrogate.server.cdn.example.com/content_1/segments/segment1_1.ts">http://surrogate.server.cdn.example.com/content_1/segments/segment1_1.ts</eref>.</t>

          <t>One drawback of using relative URLs is that it forces a CDN
          relying on HTTP-based request routing to
          deliver all segments belonging to a given content item with the same
          Surrogate that delivered the Manifest File for that content item,
          which results in limited flexibility. Another drawback is that
          relative URLs do not allow for fallback URLs; should the Surrogate
          that delivered the Manifest File break down, the client is no longer
          able to request chunks. The advantage of relative URLs is that it is
          very easy to transfer content between different Surrogates and even
          CDNs.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="absolute_with" title="Absolute URLs with Redirection">
          <t>Another method for specifying locations of chunks (or other
          Manifest Files) in a Manifest File is through the use of an absolute
          URL. An absolute URL contains a fully formed URL (i.e., the client
          does not have to calculate the URL as in the case of the relative
          URL but can use the URL from the Manifest File directly).</t>

          <t>In the context of Manifest Files, there are two types of absolute
          URLs imaginable: absolute URLs with redirection and absolute URLs
          without redirection. The two methods differ in whether the URL
          points to a request routing node that will redirect the client to a
          Surrogate (absolute URLs with redirection) or point directly to a
          Surrogate hosting the requested content (absolute URLs without
          redirection).</t>

          <t>In the case of absolute URLs with redirection, a request for a
          chunk is handled by the Request Routing system of a CDN just as if
          it were a standalone (non-HAS) content request, which might include
          looking up the Surrogate (and/or CDN) best suited for delivering the
          requested chunk to the particular user and sending an HTTP redirect
          to the user with the URL pointing to the requested chunk on the
          specified Surrogate (and/or CDN), or a DNS response pointing to the
          specific Surrogate.</t>

          <t>An example of an absolute URL with redirection might look as
          follows:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t>http://requestrouting.cdn.example.com/content_request?content=content_1&amp;segment=segment1_1.ts</t>
            </list>

          As can be seen from this example URL, the URL includes a
          pointer to a general CDN Request Routing function and some
          arguments identifying the requested segment.</t>

          <t>The advantage of using absolute URLs with redirection is that they
          allow for maximum flexibility (since chunks can be distributed
          across Surrogates and CDNs in any imaginable way) without having to
          modify the Manifest File every time one or more chunks are moved (as
          is the case when absolute URLs without redirection are used). The
          downside of this method is that it can add significant load to a
          CDN Request Routing system, since it has to perform a redirect every
          time a client requests a new chunk.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="absolute_without"
                 title="Absolute URLs without Redirection">
          <t>In the case of absolute URLs without redirection, the URL
          points directly to the specific chunk on the actual Surrogate that
          will deliver the requested chunk to the client. In other words,
          there will be no HTTP redirection operation taking place between the
          client requesting the chunk and the chunk being delivered to the
          client by the Surrogate.</t>

          <t>An example of an absolute URL without redirection is the
          following:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t>http://surrogate1.cdn.example.com/content_1/segments/segment1_1.ts</t>
            </list>As can be seen from this example URL, the URL includes both
          the identifier of the requested segment (in this case
          segment1_1.ts) and the server that is expected to deliver
          the segment (in this case surrogate1.cdn.example.com). With this,
          the client has enough information to directly request the specific
          segment from the specified Surrogate.</t>

          <t>The advantage of using absolute URLs without redirection is that
          it allows more flexibility compared to using relative URLs (since
          segments do not necessarily have to be delivered by the same server)
          while not requiring per-segment redirection (which would add
          significant load to the node doing the redirection). The drawback of
          this method is that it requires a modification of the
          Manifest File every time content is moved to a different
          location (either within a CDN or across CDNs).</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="livevod" title="Live Content versus VoD Content">
        <t>Though the formats and addresses of Manifest Files and chunk files
        do not typically differ significantly between live and Video-on-Demand
        (VoD) content, the time at which the Manifest Files and chunk files
        become available does differ significantly. For live content, chunk
        files and their corresponding Manifest Files are created and delivered
        in real time. This poses a number of potential issues for HAS
        optimization:</t>

    <section title="Possible HAS Optimizations">
      <t>In the previous section, some of the unique properties of HAS were
      discussed. Furthermore, some of the CDN-specific design decisions
      with regards to addressing chunks have been detailed. In this section,
      the impact of supporting HAS in CDNI scenarios is discussed.</t>

      <t>There are a number of topics, or problem areas, that are of
      particular interest when considering the combination of HAS and CDNI.
      For each of these problem areas, it holds that there are a number of
      different ways in which the CDNI interfaces can deal with them. In
      general, it can be said that each problem area can either be solved in a
      way that minimizes the amount of HAS-specific changes to the CDNI
      interfaces or maximizes the flexibility and efficiency with
      which the CDNI interfaces can deliver HAS content. The goal for the CDNI
      WG should probably be to try to find the middle ground between these two
      extremes and try to come up with solutions that optimize the balance
      between efficiency and additional complexity.</t>

      <t>In order to allow the WG to make this decision, this section 
      briefly describes each of the following problem areas, together with a
      number of different options for dealing with them. <xref
      target="file_management"/> discusses the problem of how to deal with
      file management of groups of files, or content collections. <xref
      target="content_acquisition"/> deals with a related topic: how to do
      content acquisition of content collections between the Upstream CDN
      (uCDN) and Downstream CDN (dCDN).
      After that, <xref target="request_routing"/> describes the various
      options for the request routing of HAS content, particularly related to
      Manifest Files. <xref target="logging"/> talks about a number of
      possible optimizations for the logging of HAS content, while <xref
      target="url_signing"/> discusses the options regarding URL signing.
      Finally, <xref target="content_purge"/> describes different scenarios
      for dealing with the removal of HAS content from CDNs.</t>

      <section anchor="file_management"
               title="File Management and Content Collections">

        <section anchor="fm_intro" title="General Remarks">
          <t>One of the unique properties of HAS content is that it does not
          consist of a single file or stream but of multiple interrelated
          files (segments, fragments, and/or Manifest Files). In this document,
          this group of files is also referred to as a content collection.
          Another important aspect is the difference between segments and
          fragments (see <xref target="segVfrag"/>).</t>

          <t>Irrespective of whether segments or fragments are used, different
          CDNs might handle content collections differently from a
          file management perspective. For example, some CDNs might handle all
          files belonging to a content collection as individual files that
          are stored independently from each other. An advantage of this
          approach is that it makes it easy to cache individual chunks. Other
          CDNs might store all fragments belonging to a content collection in
          a bundle, as if they were a single file (e.g., by using a fragmented
          MP4 container). The advantage of this approach is that it reduces
          file management overhead.</t>

          <t>The following subsections look at the various ways with
          which the CDNI interfaces might deal with these differences in
          handling content collections from a file management perspective.
          The different options can be distinguished based on the level of
          HAS awareness they require on the part of the different CDNs and
          the CDNI interfaces.</t>

            <t>This option assumes no HAS awareness in both the involved
            CDNs and the CDNI interfaces. This means that the uCDN uses
            individual files, and the dCDN is not explicitly made aware of the
            relationship between chunks and doesn't know which files are
            part of the same content collection. In practice, this scenario
            would mean that the file management method used by the uCDN is
            simply imposed on the dCDN as well.</t>

            <t>This scenario also means that it is not possible for the dCDN
            to use any form of file bundling, such as the single-file
            mechanism, which can be used to store fragmented content as a
            single file (see <xref target="segVfrag"/>). The one exception
            to this rule is the situation where the content is fragmented
            and the Manifest Files on the uCDN contain byte range requests,
            in which case the dCDN might be able to acquire fragmented
            content as a single file (see <xref target="ca_option2"/>).</t>

        <section anchor="ca_intro" title="General Remarks">
          <t>In the previous section, the relationship between file management
          and HAS in a CDNI scenario was discussed. This section 
          discusses a related topic: content acquisition between two CDNs.</t>

          <t>With regards to content acquisition, it is important to note the
          difference between CDNs that do dynamic acquisition of content and
          CDNs that perform content pre-positioning. In the case of dynamic
          acquisition, a CDN only requests a particular content item when a
          cache miss occurs. In the case of pre-positioning, a CDN
          proactively places content items on the nodes on which it expects
          traffic for that particular content item. For each of these types of
          CDNs, there might be a benefit in being HAS aware. For example, in
          the case of dynamic acquisition, being HAS aware means that after a
          cache miss for a given chunk occurs, that node might not only
          acquire the requested chunk but might also acquire some related
          chunks that are expected to be requested in the near future. In the
          case of pre-positioning, similar benefits can be had.</t>

        <section anchor="ca_options" title="Candidate Approaches">

          <section anchor="ca_option1" title="Option 2.1: No HAS Awareness">
            <t>This option assumes no HAS awareness in both the involved
            CDNs and the CDNI interfaces. Just as with Option 1.1, discussed 
            earlier with regards to file management, having no
            HAS awareness means that the dCDN is not aware of the relationship
            between chunks. In the case of content acquisition, this means
            that each and every file belonging to a content collection will
            have to be individually acquired from the uCDN by the dCDN. The
            exception to the rule is cases with fragmented content
            where the uCDN uses Manifest Files that contain byte range
            requests. In this case, the dCDN can simply omit the byte range
            identifier and acquire the complete file.</t>

            <t>The advantage of this approach is that it is highly flexible.
            If a client only requests a small portion of the chunks belonging
            to a particular content collection, the dCDN only has to acquire
            those chunks from the uCDN, saving both bandwidth and storage
            capacity.</t>

            <t>The downside of acquiring content on a per-chunk basis is that
            it creates more transaction overhead between the dCDN and uCDN,
            compared to a method in which entire content collections can be
            acquired as part of one transaction.</t>

      <section anchor="request_routing" title="Request Routing of HAS Content">

        <section anchor="rr_intro" title="General Remarks">
          <t>In this section, the effect HAS content has on request routing
          is identified. Of particular interest in this case are the
          different types of Manifest Files that might be used. In <xref
          target="addressing"/>, three different methods for identifying and
          addressing chunks from within a Manifest File were described:
          relative URLs, absolute URLs with redirection, and absolute URLs
          without redirection. Of course, not every current CDN will use and/or
          support all three methods. Some CDNs may only use one of the three
          methods, while others may support two or all three.</t>

          <t>An important factor in deciding which chunk-addressing method is
          used is the CSP. Some CSPs may have a
          strong preference for a particular method and deliver the Manifest
          Files to the CDN in a particular way. Depending on the CDN and the
          agreement it has with the CSP, a CDN may either host
          the Manifest Files as they were created by the CSP or
          modify the Manifest File to adapt it to its particular architecture
          (e.g., by changing relative URLs to absolute URLs that point to the
          CDN Request Routing function).</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="rr_options" title="Candidate Approaches">

          <section anchor="rr_option1" title="Option 3.1: No HAS Awareness">
            <t>This option assumes no HAS awareness in both the involved
            CDNs and the CDNI interfaces. This scenario also assumes that
            neither the dCDN nor the uCDN has the ability to actively
            manipulate Manifest Files. As was also discussed with regards to
            file management and content acquisition, having no HAS awareness
            means that each file constituting a content collection is handled
            on an individual basis, with the dCDN unaware of any relationship
            between files.</t>

            <t>The only chunk-addressing method that works without question in
            this case is absolute URLs with redirection. In other words, the
            CSP that ingested the content into the uCDN created a
            Manifest File with each chunk location pointing to the Request
            Routing function of the uCDN. Alternatively, the CSP
            may have ingested the Manifest File containing relative URLs, and
            the uCDN ingestion function has translated these to absolute URLs
            pointing to the Request Routing function.</t>

            <t>In this &quot;absolute URL with redirection&quot; case,
            the uCDN can simply
            have the Manifest File be delivered by the dCDN as if it were a
            regular file. Once the client parses the Manifest File, it will
            request any subsequent chunks from the uCDN Request Routing
            function. That function can then decide to outsource the delivery
            of those chunks to the dCDN. Depending on whether HTTP-based
            (recursive or iterative) or DNS-based request routing is used, the
            uCDN Request Routing function will then either directly or
            indirectly redirect the client to the Request Routing function of
            the dCDN (assuming that it does not have the necessary information
            to redirect the client directly to a Surrogate in the dCDN).</t>

            <t>The drawback of this method is that it creates a large amount
            of request routing overhead for both the uCDN and dCDN. For each
            chunk, the full inter-CDN Request Routing process is invoked (which
            can result in two HTTP redirections in the case of iterative
            redirection, or one HTTP redirection plus one CDNI
            Request Routing Redirection interface request/response). Even in
            the case where DNS-based redirection is used, there might be
            significant overhead involved, since both the dCDN and uCDN Request
            Routing functions might have to perform database lookups and query
            each other. While with DNS this overhead might be reduced by using
            DNS's inherent caching mechanism, this will have significant impact
            on the accuracy of the redirect.</t>

            <t>With no HAS awareness, relative URLs might or might not work,
            depending on the type of relative URL that is used. When a uCDN
            delegates the delivery of a Manifest File containing relative URLs
            to a dCDN, the client goes directly to the dCDN Surrogate from
            which it has received the Manifest File for every subsequent
            chunk. As long as the relative URL is not path-absolute (see <xref
            target="RFC3986"/>), this approach will work fine.</t>

            <t>Since using absolute URLs without redirection inherently
            requires a HAS-aware CDN, absolute URLs without redirection
            cannot be used in this case because the URLs in the
            Manifest File will point directly to a Surrogate in the uCDN.
            Since this scenario assumes no HAS awareness on the part of
            the dCDN or uCDN, it is impossible for either of these CDNs
            to rewrite the Manifest File and thus allow the client to either
            go to a Surrogate in the dCDN or to a Request Routing function.</t>

                   title="Option 3.2: Manifest File Rewriting by uCDN">
            <t>While Option 3.1 does allow absolute URLs with redirection
            to be used, it does so in a way that creates a high level of
            request routing overhead for both the dCDN and the uCDN. This
            option presents a solution to significantly reduce this
            overhead.</t>

            <t>In this scenario, the uCDN is able to rewrite the Manifest File
            (or generate a new one) to be able to remove itself from the
            request routing chain for chunks being referenced in the Manifest
            File. As described in <xref target="rr_option1"/>, in the case of
            no HAS awareness, the client will go to the uCDN Request Routing
            function for each chunk request. This Request Routing function can
            then redirect the client to the dCDN Request Routing function. By
            rewriting the Manifest File (or generating a new one), the uCDN is
            able to remove this first step and have the Manifest File point
            directly to the dCDN Request Routing function.</t>

            <t>A key advantage of this solution is that it does not directly
            have an impact on the CDNI interfaces and is therefore transparent
            to these interfaces. It is a CDN-internal function that a uCDN can
            perform autonomously by using information configured for regular
            CDNI operation or received from the dCDN as part of the
            regular communication using the CDNI Request Routing Redirection
            interface.</t>

            <t>More specifically, in order for the uCDN to rewrite the
            Manifest File, the minimum information needed is the location of
            the dCDN Request Routing function (or, alternatively, the location
            of the dCDN delivering Surrogate). This information can be
            available from configuration or can be derived from the regular
            CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface. For example, the uCDN
            may ask the dCDN for the location of its request routing node
            (through the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface) every
            time a request for a Manifest File is received and processed by
            the uCDN Request Routing function. The uCDN would then modify the
            Manifest File and deliver the Manifest File to the client. One
            advantage of this method is that it maximizes efficiency and
            flexibility by allowing the dCDN to optionally respond with the
            locations of its Surrogates instead of the location of its Request
            Routing function (and effectively turning the URLs into absolute
            URLs without redirection). There are many variations on this
            approach, such as where the modification of the Manifest File is
            only performed once (or once per period of time) by the uCDN
            Request Routing function, when the first client for that
            particular content collection (and redirected to that particular
            dCDN) sends a Manifest File request. The advantage of such a
            variation is that the uCDN only has to modify the Manifest File
            once (or once per time period). The drawback of this variation is
            that the dCDN is no longer in a position to influence the request
            routing decision across individual content requests.</t>

            <t>It should be noted that there are a number of things to take
            into account when changing a Manifest File (see, for example,
            Sections <xref target="livevod" format="counter"/>
            and <xref target="splicing" format="counter"/> on live HAS
            content and ad insertion). Furthermore, some CSPs
            might have issues with a CDN changing Manifest Files. However, in
            this option the Manifest File manipulation is only being performed
            by the uCDN, which can be expected to be aware of these
            limitations if it wants to perform Manifest File manipulation,
            since it is in its own best interest that its customer's content
            gets delivered in the proper way and since there is a direct
            commercial and technical relationship between the uCDN (the
            Authoritative CDN in this scenario) and its customer (the CSP).
            Should the CSP want to limit Manifest File
            manipulation, it can simply arrange this with the uCDN
            bilaterally.</t>

                   title="Option 3.3: Two-Step Manifest File Rewriting">
            <t>One of the possibilities with Option 3.2 is allowing the dCDN
            to provide the locations of a specific Surrogate to the uCDN, so
            that the uCDN can fit the Manifest File with absolute URLs without
            redirection and the client can request chunks directly from a dCDN
            Surrogate. However, some dCDNs might not be willing to provide
            this information to the uCDN. In that case, they can only provide
            the uCDN with the location of their Request Routing function,
            thereby preventing the use of absolute URLs without
            redirection.</t>

            <t>One method for solving this limitation is allowing two-step
            Manifest File manipulation. In the first step, the uCDN would
            perform its own modification and place the locations of the dCDN
            Request Routing function in the Manifest File. Then, once a
            request for the Manifest File comes in at the dCDN Request Routing
            function, it would perform a second modification in which it
            replaces the URLs in the Manifest Files with the URLs of its
            Surrogates. This way, the dCDN can still profit from having limited
            request routing traffic while not having to share sensitive
            Surrogate information with the uCDN.</t>

            <t>The downside of this approach is that it not only assumes HAS
            awareness in the dCDN but also requires some HAS-specific
            additions to the CDNI Metadata interface. In order for the dCDN to
            be able to change the Manifest File, it has to have some
            information about the structure of the content. Specifically, it
            needs to have information about which chunks make up the
            content collection.</t>

        <section anchor="rr_rec" title="Recommendations">
          <t>Based on the listed pros and cons, the authors recommend going
          for Option 3.1, with Option 3.2 as an optional feature that may be
          supported as a CDN-internal behavior by a uCDN. While Option 3.1
          allows for HAS content to be delivered using the CDNI interfaces, it
          does so with some limitations regarding supported Manifest Files
          and, in some cases, with a large amount of signaling overhead.
          Option 3.2 can solve most of these limitations and presents a
          significant reduction in request routing overhead.
          Since Option 3.2 does not require
          any changes to the CDNI interfaces but only changes the way the uCDN
          uses the existing interfaces, supporting it is not expected to
          result in a significant delay of the WG's milestones. The authors
          recommend that the WG not include Option 3.3, since it raises some
          questions of potential brittleness and including it would result in
          a significant delay of the WG's milestones.</t>

        <section anchor="l_intro" title="General Remarks">
          <t>As stated in <xref target="RFC6707"/>, the CDNI Logging
          interface enables details of logs or events to be exchanged between
          interconnected CDNs.</t>

          <t>As discussed in <xref target="CDNI-LOGGING"/>,
          the CDNI logging information can be used for multiple purposes,
          including maintenance/debugging by a uCDN, accounting (e.g., for
          billing or settlement purposes), reporting and management of
          end-user experience (e.g., to the CSP), analytics
          (e.g., by the CSP), and control of content distribution policy
          enforcement (e.g., by the CSP).</t>

          <t>The key consideration for HAS with respect to logging is the
          potential increase of the number of log records by two to three
          orders of magnitude, as compared to regular HTTP delivery of a
          video, since by default log records would typically be generated
          on a per-chunk-delivery basis instead of a per-content-item-delivery
          basis. This impacts the scale of every processing step in the
          logging process (see <xref target="CDNI-LOGGING"/>), including:</t>

              <t>Logging information manipulation (including information
              protection, filtering, update, and rectification)</t>

              <t>(Where needed) CDNI reformatting of logging information (e.g.,
              reformatting from a CDN-specific format to the CDNI Logging
              interface format for export by the dCDN to the uCDN)</t>

              <t>Logging exchange via the CDNI Logging interface</t>

              <t>(Where needed) Logging re-reformatting (e.g., reformatting
              from the CDNI Logging interface format into a log-consuming
              application)</t>

              <t>Logging consumption/processing (e.g., feed logs into uCDN
              accounting application, feed logs into uCDN reporting system to
              provide per-CSP views, feed logs into debugging tools)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Note that there may be multiple instances of steps [f] and [g]
          running in parallel.</t>

          <t>While the CDNI Logging interface is only used to perform step
          [e], we note that its format directly affects steps [d] and [f] and
          that its format also indirectly affects the other steps (for example,
          if the CDNI Logging interface requires per-chunk log records, steps
          [a], [b], and [d] cannot operate on a per-HAS-session basis, and they
          also need to operate on a per-chunk basis).</t>

          for CDNI in terms of dealing with HAS with respect to logging.</t>

          <section anchor="l_option1"
                   title="Option 4.1: Do Nothing">
            <t>In this approach, nothing is done specifically for HAS, so
            each HAS-chunk delivery is considered, for CDNI logging, as a
            standalone content delivery. In particular, a separate log record
            for each HAS-chunk delivery is included in the CDNI Logging
            interface in step [e] (as defined in <xref target="l_intro"/>).
            This approach requires that steps [a], [b], [c], [d], and [f] also
            be performed on a per-chunk basis. This approach allows step [g]
            to be performed either on a per-chunk basis (assuming that
            step [f] maintains per-chunk records) or in a more
            "summarized" manner, such as on a per-HAS-session basis
            (assuming that step [f] summarizes per-chunk records into
            per-HAS-session records).</t>

              </list></t>

            <t>An interesting question is whether a dCDN could use the CDNI
            Logging interface specified for the &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;
            approach to report summarized &ldquo;per-session&rdquo; log
            information in the case where the dCDN performs such
            summarization. The high-level idea would be that when a dCDN
            performs HAS log summarization, for its own purposes anyway, this
            dCDN could include in the CDNI Logging interface one or more
            log entries for a HAS session (instead of one entry per HAS chunk)
            that summarize the deliveries of many/all HAS chunks for a
            session. However, the authors feel that when considering the
            details of this idea, it is not achievable without explicit
            agreement between the uCDN and dCDN about how to
            perform/interpret such summarization. For example, when a
            HAS session switches between representations, the uCDN and
            dCDN would have to agree on things such as:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>whether the session will be represented by a single log
                entry (which therefore cannot convey the distribution across
                representations), or multiple log entries, such as one entry
                per contiguous period at a given representation (which
                therefore would be generally very difficult to correlate back
                into a single session)</t>

                <t>what the single URI included in the log entry would
                correspond to (for example, the
                Manifest File, top-level playlist, or next-level playlist,
                &hellip;)</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>The authors feel that since explicit agreement is needed between
            the uCDN and dCDN on how to perform/interpret the summarization,
            this method can only work if it is specified as part of the
            CDNI Logging interface, in which case it would effectively boil
            down to Option 4.4 (full HAS awareness / per-session logs)
            as defined below.</t>

            <t>We note that support by CDNI of a mechanism (independent of
            HAS) allowing the customization of the fields to be reported in
            log entries by the dCDN to the uCDN would mitigate concerns
            related to the scaling of HAS logging, because it ensures that only
            the necessary subset of fields is actually stored, reported, and
            processed.</t>

            field is distributed through the CDNI Metadata interface, and the
            same CCID value is associated through the CDNI Metadata interface
            with every chunk of the same content collection. The CCID value
            needs to be such that it allows, in combination with the content
            URI, unique identification of a content collection. When
            the CCID is distributed,
            and CCID logging is requested from the dCDN, the dCDN Surrogates
            are to store the CCID value in the corresponding log entries. The
            objective of this field is to facilitate optional summarization of
            per-chunk records at step [f] into something along the lines of
            per-HAS-session logs, at least for the log-consuming applications
            that do not require per-chunk detailed information (for example,
            billing).</t>

            <t>We note that if the dCDN happens to have sufficient
            HAS awareness to be able to generate a "Session IDentifier
            (Session-ID)", optionally including such a Session-ID (in addition
            to the CCID) in the per-chunk log record would further facilitate
            optional summarization at step [f].
            The Session-ID value to be included in a log record by the
            delivering CDN is such that</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>different per-chunk log records with the same Session-ID
                value must correspond to the same user session (i.e., delivery
                of the same content to the same End User at a given point in
                time).</t>

                <t>log records for different chunks of the same user session
                (i.e., delivery of the same content to the same End User at a
                given point in time) should be provided with the same
                Session-ID value.
                While undesirable, there may be situations where the
                delivering CDN uses more than one Session-ID value for
                different per-chunk log records of a given session -- for
                example, in scenarios of fail-over or load balancing across
                multiple Surrogates and where the delivering CDN does not
                implement mechanisms to synchronize Session-IDs across
                Surrogates.</t>

          <t>When performing dCDN selection, a uCDN may want to take into
          account whether a given dCDN is capable of reporting the CCID and
          Session-ID. Thus, the authors recommend that the ability of a dCDN
          to advertise its support of the optional CCID and Session-ID
          capability be supported by the CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities
          Advertisement interface as a &ldquo;Medium Priority&rdquo; (as
          defined in <xref target="CDNI-REQUIREMENTS"/>).
          </t>

          <t>The authors also recommend that a generic mechanism (independent
          of HAS) be supported that allows the customization of the fields to
          be reported in logs by CDNs over the CDNI Logging interface --
          because of the reduction of the logging information volume exchanged
          across CDNs that it allows by removing information that is not of
          interest to the other CDN.</t>

          <t>Because the following can be achieved with very little complexity
          and can provide some clear storage/communication compression
          benefits, the authors recommend that, in line with the concept of
          Option 4.3, some existing very common compression techniques
          (e.g., gzip) be supported by the CDNI Logging interface as a
          &ldquo;Medium Priority&rdquo; (as defined
          in <xref target="CDNI-REQUIREMENTS"/>) and be an optional
          capability of CDNs implementing CDNI.</t>

          <t>Because of its complexity, the time it would take to understand
          the trade-offs of candidate summarization approaches, and the time it
          would take to specify the corresponding support in the CDNI Logging
          interface, the authors recommend that the log summarization
          discussed in <xref target="l_option4"/> (Option 4.4)
          not be supported by the CDNI Logging interface
          at this stage but that it be kept as a candidate topic of
          great interest for a rechartering of the CDNI WG once the first set
          of deliverables is produced. At that time, we suggest investigating
          the notion of complementing a &ldquo;push style&rdquo; CDNI
          Logging interface that would support summarization via an on-demand
          &ldquo;pull type&rdquo; interface that would in turn allow a uCDN to
          request the subset of the detailed logging information that it
          may need but that is lost in the summarized pushed information.</t>

          <t>The authors note that while a CDN only needs to adhere to the
          CDNI Logging interface on its external interfaces and can perform
          logging in a different format within the CDN, any possible CDNI
          logging approach effectively places some constraints on the dCDN
          logging format. For example, to support the &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;
          approach, a CDN needs to perform and retain per-chunk logs. As
          another example, to support the "full HAS awareness/per-session
          logs" approach, the dCDN cannot use a logging format that
          summarizes data in a way that is incompatible with the summarization
          specified for CDNI logging (e.g., summarizes data into a smaller set
          of information than what is specified for CDNI logging).
          However, the authors feel that such
          constraints are (i) inevitable, (ii) outweighed by the benefits of a
          standardized logging interface, and (iii) acceptable because, in the
          case of incompatible summarization, most or all CDNs are capable of
          reverting to per-chunk logging as per the "do nothing" approach that
          we recommend as the base mandatory approach.</t>

      <section anchor="url_signing" title="URL Signing">
        <t>URL signing is an authorization method for content delivery. This
        is based on embedding the HTTP URL with information that can be
        validated to ensure that the request has legitimate access to the
        content. There are two parts: 1) parameters that convey authorization
        restrictions (e.g., source IP address and time period) and/or a 
        protected URL portion, and 2) a message digest that confirms the
        integrity of the URL and authenticates the entity that creates the URL.
        The authorization parameters can be anything agreed upon between the
        entity that creates the URL and the entity that validates the URL.
        A key is used to generate the message digest (i.e., sign the URL) and
        validate the message digest. The two functions may or may not use the
        same key.</t>

        <t>There are two types of keys used for URL signing: asymmetric keys
        and symmetric keys. Asymmetric keys always have a key pair made up of a
        public key and private key. The private key and public key are used
        for signing and validating the URL, respectively. A symmetric key is
        the same key that is used for both functions. Regardless of the type
        of key, the entity that validates the URL has to obtain the key.
        Distribution of the symmetric key requires security to prevent others
        from taking it. A public key can be distributed freely, while
        a private key is kept by the URL signer. The method for key
        distribution is out of scope for this document.</t>

        <t>URL signing operates in the following way. A signed URL is provided
        by the content owner (i.e., URL signer) to the user during website
        navigation. When the user selects the URL, the HTTP request is sent to
        the CDN, which validates that URL before delivering the content.</t>

        <section title="HAS Implications">
          <t>The authorization lifetime for URL signing is affected by HAS.
          The expiration time in the authorization parameters of URL signing
          limits the period that the content referenced by the URL can be
          accessed. This works for URLs that directly access the media content,
          but for HAS content the Manifest File contains another layer of URLs
          that reference the chunks. The chunk URL that is embedded in the
          content may be requested some undetermined amount of time later.
          The time period between access to the Manifest File and chunk
          retrieval may vary significantly. The type of content (i.e., live or
          VoD) impacts this time variance as well. This property of HAS
          content needs to be addressed for URL signing.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="CDNI Considerations">
          <t>For CDNI, the two types of request routing are DNS-based and
          HTTP-based. The use of symmetric vs. asymmetric keys for URL signing
          has implications for the trust model between the CSP and CDNs and
          for the key distribution method that can be used.</t>

          <t>DNS-based request routing does not change the URL. In the case of
          a symmetric key, the CSP and the Authoritative CDN have a business
          relationship that allows them to share a key (or multiple keys) for
          URL signing. When the user requests content from the Authoritative
          CDN, the URL is signed by the CSP. The Authoritative CDN (as a
          uCDN) redirects the request to a dCDN via DNS.
          There may be more than one level of redirection to reach the
          delivering CDN. The user would obtain the IP address from DNS and
          send the HTTP request to the delivering CDN, which needs to validate
          the URL. This requires that the key be distributed from the
          Authoritative CDN to the delivering CDN. This may be problematic
          when the key is exposed to a delivering CDN that does not have a
          relationship with the CSP. The combination of DNS-based request
          routing and symmetric key function is a generic issue for
          URL signing and not specific to HAS content. In the case of
          asymmetric keys, the CSP signs the URL with its private key.
          The delivering CDN validates the URL with the associated public
          key.</t>

          <t>HTTP-based request routing changes the URL during the
          redirection procedure. In the case of a symmetric key, the CSP
          signs the original URL with the same key used by the Authoritative
          CDN to validate the URL. The Authoritative CDN (as a uCDN)
          redirects the request to the dCDN. The new URL is signed by the
          uCDN with the same key used by the dCDN to validate that URL. The
          key used by the uCDN to validate the original URL is expected
          to be different than the key used to sign the new URL. In the case
          of asymmetric keys, the CSP signs the original URL with its private
          key. The Authoritative CDN validates that URL with the CSP's public
          key. The Authoritative CDN redirects the request to the dCDN. The
          new URL is signed by the uCDN with its private key. The
          dCDN validates that URL with the uCDN's public
          key. There may be more than one level of redirection to reach the
          delivering CDN. The URL signing operation described previously
          applies at each level between the uCDN and dCDN for both symmetric
          keys and asymmetric keys.</t>

          <t>URL signing requires support in most of the CDNI interfaces. The
          CDNI Metadata interface should specify the content that is subject
          to URL signing and provide information to perform the function. The
          dCDN should inform the uCDN that it supports URL
          signing in the asynchronous capabilities information advertisement
          as part of the Request Routing interface. This allows the CDN
          selection function in request routing to choose the dCDN
          with URL signing capability when the CDNI Metadata of the content
          requires this authorization method. The logging interface provides
          information on the authorization method (e.g., URL signing) and
          related authorization parameters used for content delivery. Having
          the information in the URL is not sufficient to know that the
          Surrogate enforced the authorization. URL signing has no impact on
          the control interface.</t>

        <section anchor="url_flex_csp"
                 title="Option 5.2: Flexible URL Signing by CSP">
          <t>In addition to URL signing for the top-level Manifest File, the CSP
          performs flexible URL signing for the lower-level Manifest Files and
          chunks. For each HAS session, the top-level Manifest File contains
          signed chunk URLs or signed lower-level Manifest File URLs for the
          specific session. The lower-level Manifest File contains
          session-based signed chunk URLs. The CSP generates the Manifest Files
          dynamically for the session. The chunk (segment/fragment) is
          delivered with content access authorization using flexible URL
          signing, which protects the invariant portion of the URL.
          A &quot;segment&quot; URL (e.g., HLS) is individually signed
          for the invariant URL portion
          (relative URL) or the entire URL (absolute URL without redirection)
          in the Manifest File. A &quot;fragment&quot; URL (e.g.,
          HTTP Smooth Streaming) is signed
          for the invariant portion of the template URL in the Manifest File.
          More details are provided later in this section. The URL signing
          expiration time for the chunk needs to be long enough to play the
          video. There are implications related to signing the URLs in the
          Manifest File. For live content, the Manifest Files are requested at
          a high frequency. For VoD content, the Manifest File may be quite
          large. URL signing can add more computational load and delivery
          latency in high-volume cases.</t>

          <t>For HAS content, the Manifest File contains the relative URL,
          absolute URL without redirection, or absolute URL with
          redirection for specifying the chunk location. Signing the chunk URL
          requires that the CSP know the portion of the URL that remains when
          the content is requested from the delivering CDN Surrogate.</t>

          <t>For absolute URLs without redirection, the CSP knows that the
          chunk URL is explicitly linked with the delivering CDN Surrogate
          and can sign the URL based on that information. Since the entire URL
          is set and does not change, the Surrogate can validate the URL. The
          CSP and the delivering CDN are expected to have a business
          relationship in this case, and so either symmetric keys or asymmetric
          keys can be used for URL signing.</t>

          <t>For relative URLs, the URL of the Manifest File provides the root
          location. The method of request routing affects the URL used to
          ultimately request the chunk from the delivering CDN Surrogate. For
          DNS, the original URL does not change. This allows the CSP to sign the
          chunk URL based on the Manifest File URL and the relative URL. For
          HTTP, the URL changes during redirection. In this case, the CSP does not
          know the redirected URL that will be used to request the Manifest
          File. This uncertainty makes it impossible to accurately sign the
          chunk URLs in the Manifest File. Basically, URL signing using this
          reference method "as is" for protection of the entire URL is not
          supported. However, instead of signing the entire URL, the CSP signs
          the relative URL (i.e., the invariant portion of the URL) and conveys the
          protected portion in the authorization parameters embedded in the
          chunk URL. This approach works in the same way as absolute URLs without
          redirection, except that the HOST part and (part of) the PATH part of the
          URL are not signed and validated. The security level should remain
          the same, as content access authorization ensures that the user that
          requested the content has the proper credentials.
          This scheme does not seem
          to compromise the authorization model, since the resource is still
          protected by the authorization parameters and message digest.
          Further evaluation of security might be helpful.</t>

          <t>For absolute URLs with redirection, the method of request routing
          affects the URL used to ultimately request the chunk from the
          delivering CDN Surrogate. This case has the same conditions as those
          indicated above for the relative URL. The difference is that
          the URL is for the chunk instead of the Manifest File. For DNS,
          the chunk URL does not change and can be signed by the CSP. For
          HTTP, the URL used to deliver the chunk is unknown to the CSP.
          In this case, the CSP cannot sign the URL, and this method of
          reference for the chunk is not supported.</t>

                 title="Option 5.5: HAS Awareness with HTTP Cookie in CDN">
          <t>The CDN is aware of HAS content and uses URL signing and HTTP
          cookies for content access authorization. URL signing is
          fundamentally about authorizing access to a content item or its
          specific content collections (representations)
          for a specific user during a time
          period, possibly also using some other criteria. A chunk is an
          instance of the sets of chunks referenced by the Manifest File
          for the content item or its specific content collections. This
          relationship means that once the dCDN has authorized the
          Manifest File, it can assume that the associated chunks are
          implicitly authorized. The new function for the CDN is to link
          the Manifest File with the chunks for the HTTP session. This
          can be accomplished by using an HTTP cookie for the HAS session.</t>

          <t>After validating the URL and detecting that the requested content
          is a top-level Manifest File, the delivering CDN Surrogate
          sets an HTTP cookie with a
          signed session token for the HTTP session. When a
          request for a lower-level Manifest File or chunk arrives, the
          Surrogate confirms that the HTTP cookie value contains the correct
          session token. If so, the lower-level Manifest File or chunk is
          delivered in accordance with the transitive authorization mechanism.
          The duration of the chunk access may be included in the URL signing
          of the top-level Manifest File and set in the cookie. The details
          of the operation are left to be determined later.</t>

          <t>The authors consider Option 5.1 (do nothing) unsuitable
          for access control of HAS content.</t>

          <t>Where the HTTP cookie mechanism is supported by the targeted User
          Agents and the security requirements can be addressed through the
          proper use of HTTP cookies, the authors recommend using Option 5.4
          (Authorization Group ID and HTTP cookie) and therefore that
          Option&nbsp;5.4 be supported by the CDNI solution.  This method
          does not require Manifest File manipulation, as Manifest File
          manipulation may be a significant obstacle to deployment.
          Otherwise, the authors recommend that Option 5.2 (flexible URL
          signing by the CSP) or Option&nbsp;5.3 (flexible URL signing by the
          uCDN) be used and therefore that flexible URL signing be supported
          by the CDNI solution. Options&nbsp;5.2 and 5.3 protect all the
          content, do not require that the dCDN be aware of HAS, do
          not impact CDNI interfaces, support all different types of devices,
          and support the common cases of request routing for HAS content
          (i.e., DNS-based request routing with asymmetric keys and HTTP-based
          request routing for relative URLs).</t>

          <t>Options 5.5 and 5.6 (HAS awareness in CDNs using HTTP cookies or
          Manifest Files) have some
          advantages that should be considered for future support (e.g., a CDN
          that is aware of HAS content can manage the content more efficiently
          in a broader context). Content distribution, storage, delivery,
          deletion, access authorization, etc. can all benefit. Including
          HAS awareness as part of the current CDNI charter, however, would
          almost certainly delay the CDNI WG's milestones, and the authors
          therefore do not recommend it right now.</t>

      <section anchor="content_purge" title="Content Purge">
        <t>At some point in time, a uCDN might want to remove content from a
        dCDN. With regular content, this process can be relatively
        straightforward; a uCDN will typically send the request for content
        removal to the dCDN, including a reference to the content that it
        wants to remove (e.g., in the form of a URL). However, due to the
        fact that HAS content consists of large groups of files, things
        might be
        more complex. <xref target="file_management"/> described a number of
        different scenarios for doing file management on these groups of
        files, while <xref target="content_acquisition"/> listed the options for
        performing content acquisition on these content collections. This
        section presents the options for requesting a content purge for
        the removal of a content collection from a dCDN.</t>

        <section anchor="cp_option1" title="Option 6.1: No HAS Awareness">
          <t>The most straightforward way to signal content purge requests is
          to just send a single purge request for every file that makes up the
          content collection. While this method is very simple and does not
          require HAS awareness, it obviously creates signaling overhead
          between the uCDN and dCDN, since a reference is to be provided for
          each content chunk to be purged.</t>

              <t hangText="-">Requires individual purge request for every file
              making up a content collection (or, alternatively, requires the
              ability to convey references to all the chunks making up a
              content collection inside a purge request), which creates
              signaling overhead</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="cp_option2" title="Option 6.2: Purge Identifiers">
          <t>There exists a potentially more efficient method for performing
          content removal of large numbers of files simultaneously. By
          including a "Purge IDentifier (Purge-ID)" in the metadata of a
          particular file, it is possible to virtually group together
          different files making up a content collection. A Purge-ID can take
          the form of an arbitrary number or string that is communicated as
          part of the CDNI Metadata interface, and that is the same for all
          files making up a particular content item but different across
          different content items. If a uCDN wants to request that the dCDN
          remove a content collection, it can send a purge request containing
          this Purge-ID. The dCDN can then remove all files that share the
          corresponding Purge-ID.</t>

          <t>The advantage of this method is that it is relatively simple to
          use by both the dCDN and uCDN and requires only limited additions
          to the CDNI Metadata interface and CDNI Control interface.</t>

          <t>The Purge-ID is similar to the CCID discussed in
          <xref target="l_option2"/> for handling HAS logging, and we note that
          further thought is needed to determine whether the CCID and Purge-ID
          should be collapsed into a single element or remain separate
          elements.</t>

          <t>Effect on CDNI interfaces:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>CDNI Metadata interface: Add metadata field for indicating
              Purge&nbhy;ID</t>

              <t>CDNI Control interface: Add functionality to convey a
              Purge-ID in purge requests</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Advantages/Drawbacks:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="+">Allows for efficient purging of content from a

        <section anchor="cp_rec" title="Recommendations">
          <t>Based on the listed pros and cons, the authors recommend that
          the WG have mandatory support for Option 1.1 (do nothing).
          In addition, because of its very low complexity and 
          its benefit in facilitating low-overhead purge of large numbers
          of content items simultaneously, the authors recommend that
          Purge-IDs (Option 6.2; see <xref target="cp_option2"/>) be
          supported as an optional feature by the CDNI Metadata interface
          and the CDNI Control interface.</t>

      <section title="Other Issues">
        <t>This section includes some HAS-specific issues that came up during

        categories discussed in the previous sections.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="-">As described in <xref target="addressing"/>, a
            Manifest File might be delivered by either a CDN or the CSP and
            thereby be invisible to the CDN delivering the chunks.
            Obviously, the decision of whether the CDN or CSP delivers the
            Manifest File is made between the uCDN and CSP, and the dCDN has
            no choice in the matter. However, some dCDNs might only want to
            offer their services in the cases where they have access to the
            Manifest File (e.g., because their internal architecture is based
            on the knowledge inside the Manifest File). For these cases,
            it might be useful to include a field in the CDNI Capability
            Advertisement to allow dCDNs to advertise the fact that they
            require access to the Manifest File.</t>
