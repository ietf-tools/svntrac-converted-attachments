	This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.2.0 and
	Unicode 12.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  Some additions and
	changes have been made in the Unicode Standard that affect the
	values produced by the algorithm IDNA2008 specifies. IDNA2008
	allows adding exceptions to the algorithm for backward
	compatibility; however, this document does not add any such
	exceptions. This document provides the necessary tables to
	IANA to make its database consisstent with Unicode 12.0.0.
      </t>
      <t>
	To improve understanding, this document describes systems that
	are being used as alternatives to those that conform to

      <t>
	The current version of Internationalized Domain Names for
	Applications (IDNA) was initiated in 2008, and despite not
	being completed until 2010, is widely known as "IDNA2008". It
	is specified in the series of documents listed in
	<xref target='idna2008'/>. The IDNA2008 standard includes an
	algorithm by which a derived property value is calculated
	based on the properties defined from the Unicode Standard.
      </t>
      <t>
	The derived property values that can be calculated are defined
	in <xref target='RFC5892'>RFC 5892</xref>. The summary below
	is a summary to make the reading of this document easier. For
	definition of the terms, please see <xref target='RFC5892'>RFC
	  5892</xref>.

	  <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
	        PROTOCOL VALID: Those that are allowed to be used in IDNs.
	        Code points with this property value are permitted for
	        general use in IDNs.  However, that a label consists only
	        of code points that have this property value does not
	        imply that the label can be used in DNS. The abbreviated
	        term PVALID is used to refer to this value.
	      </li><!-- CONVERT </t> replaced with </li> -->
	    <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
	          CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED: Some characteristics of the
            character, such as it being invisible in certain contexts
            or problematic in others, require that it not be used in
            labels unless specific other characters or properties are
            present.  The abbreviated term CONTEXT is used to refer to
            this value.
	        </li><!-- CONVERT </t> replaced with </li> -->
	      <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
		    DISALLOWED: Those that should clearly not be included in
		    IDNs.  Code points with this property value are not
		    permitted in IDNs.
		  </li><!-- CONVERT </t> replaced with </li> -->
	        <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
		      UNASSIGNED: Those code points that are not designated (i.e., are
		      unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.
		    </li><!-- CONVERT </t> replaced with </li> -->
		</ul><t><!-- CONVERT </list> replaced with </ul> -->
      </t>
      <t>
	When the Unicode Standard is updated, new code points are assigned
	and already-assigned code points can have their property values changed. 
	</t><ul spacing='compact'><!-- CONVERT converting <list> to <ul> -->
	  <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
	        Assigning code points can create problems if the
	        newly-assigned code points are compositions of existing
	        code points and because of that the normalization
	        relationships associated with those code points should
	        have been changed.
	      </li><!-- CONVERT </t> replaced with </li> -->
	    <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
	          Changing properties for already-assigned code points can
	          create problems if the property change results in changes
	          to the derived property value. This might make an earlier
	          allowed code point whose derived property value is PVALID
	          to then not be allowed anymore if its derived property
	          value changes to DISALLOWED.  The problem can also happen
	          the other way around: a code point that was not allowed
	          (and thus is prohibited) can suddenly end up being
	          allowed.
	        </li><!-- CONVERT </t> replaced with </li> -->
	      <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
		    Problems can also be created if the properties assigned to
		    those code points are inconsistent with IDNA2008
		    assumptions about how properties are assigned and/or about
		    how code points with those properties are used or behave.

      <t>
	There were three incompatible changes in the Unicode standard
	after <xref target='Unicode-5.2.0'>Unicode 5.2.0</xref> up to
	including <xref target='Unicode-6.0.0'>Unicode 6.0.0</xref>,
	as described in <xref target='RFC6452'>RFC 6452</xref>. The
	code points U+0CF1 and U+0CF2 had a derived property value
	change from DISALLOWED to PVALID while U+19DA had a change in
	derived property value from PVALID to DISALLOWED. They were
	examined in great detail and IETF concluded that the consensus
	is that no update was needed to <xref target='RFC5892'>RFC
	  5892</xref> based on the changes made to the Unicode standard.
      </t>
      <t>
	As described in <xref target='changes'/>, more changes have
	been made to code points between Unicode version 6.0.0 and
	<xref target='Unicode-12.0.0'>Unicode version 12.0.0</xref> so
	that the derived property values have been changed in an
	incompatible way.  This document concludes that no exceptions
	are to be added to <xref target='RFC5892'>RFC 5892</xref>
	even though there are changes in the derived property value as
	a result of the changes made in Unicode between version 6.2.0
	and 12.0.0.
      </t>
      <t>
	Further, in 2015, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
	issued <xref target='IAB'>a statement</xref> which requested
	the IETF to resolve the issues related to the code point
	ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) that was
	introduced in <xref target='Unicode-7.0.0'>Unicode
	  7.0.0</xref>. This document concludes that this code point is
	not to be added to the exception list either. It should be
	noted that the review on U+08A1 indicated that it is not an
	isolated case and that a number of PVALID code points of long
	standing may have similar issues. The problem is described in
	more detail in a document in progress,
	<xref target='I-D.klensin-idna-5892upd-unicode70'>draft-klensin-idna-5892upd-unicode70</xref>.
	A fuller resolution of this issue may require future changes
	to IDNA2008 or additional specifications, but there is
	insufficient understanding yet of what would constitute the
	best approach.

	    There are many variations on the general IDNA model in use

		      Those specifications are dependent on case folding and
		      NFKC normalization and on tables that specify for each
		      code point whether it is allowed to be used or not, with
		      a distinction made between use for "stored strings" and

              A number of variations on IDNA2003, sometimes presented

              and <xref target='RFC3491'>Nameprep</xref> would have

	    In practice, the Unicode Consortium creates a maximum set of
	    code points by assigning code points in the Unicode
	    Standard. The IDNA2008 rules use the Unicode Standard to
	    create a further subset of code points and context that are
	    permitted in DNS labels associated with its PVALID,
	    CONTEXTJ, and CONTEXTO derived property values. DNS
	    registries and other organizations that deal with IDNs are
	    supposed to create their own subsets from IDNA2008 for use
	    by those registries and organizations.
	  </t>
	<t>
	    This progressing subsetting and narrowing of the repertoire
          of code points that can be used in labels is an
          implementation of the principles of being conservative when
          deciding what code points to include in such a subset.
	      <xref target='SAC-084'>SAC-084</xref>
	        and <xref target='RFC6912'>RFC 6912</xref> recommend to DNS
	        registries and other organizations to be conservative when
	        creating their subsets, and to use the principle of creating
	        subsets by inclusion.

	    The character ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) was
	      introduced in Unicode 7.0.0. This was discussed extensively in the IETF,
	      and by the IAB in <xref target='IAB'>their
	      statement</xref> requesting the IETF to investigate the
	      issue. Specifically, the IAB stated:
	    </t>
	<t>
	    </t><ul empty='true' spacing='compact'><!-- CONVERT converting empty style to <ul empty=true> -->
<!-- CONVERT converting <list> to <ul> -->
    <li><!-- CONVERT converting <t> to <li> -->
            On the same precautionary principle, the IAB recommends
            that the Internationalized Domain Names for Applications
            (IDNA) Parameters registry
            (http://www.iana.org/assignments/idna-tables/) not be
            updated to Unicode 7.0.0 until the IETF has consensus on a
            solution to this problem.
          </li><!-- CONVERT </t> replaced with </li> -->
      </ul><t><!-- CONVERT </list> replaced with </ul> -->
	  </t>
	<t>
	    The discussion in the IETF concluded that although it is
	      possible to create "the same" character in multiple ways,
	      the issue with U+08A1 is not unique.  The character U+08A1
	      (ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE) can be represented with
	      the sequence ARABIC LETTER BEH (U+0628) and ARABIC HAMZA
	      ABOVE (U+0654). This identical to LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH
	      STROKE (U+00F8), which can be represented with the sequence
	      LATIN SMALL LETTER O (U+006F) followed by COMBINING SHORT
	      SOLIDUS OVERLAY (U+0337).
	    </t>
	<t>
	    Although the discussion about this specific code point
	      resulted in acceptance of the derived property value of
	      PVALID, the underlying problem with combining sequences is
	      not understood fully. Therefore it cannot be claimed that
	      this case can be extrapolated to other situtions and other
	      code points.

      <t>
	As one can see in <xref target='changes'/>, there is one incompatible
	change made between Unicode 6.2.0 and 12.0.0, the code point U+111C9.
	It has changed derived property value from DISALLOWED to PVALID. In
	situations like these, IDNA2008 allow for addition of rules to
	<xref target='RFC5892'>RFC 5892</xref> section
	2.7. (BackwardCompatible (G)).  The code point if being
	accepted might due to implementations of IDNA2008 based on
	older versions of Unicode than 11.0.0 be rejected. As the
	character is rarely used outside of the group of Sharada
	specialists, and used in some records for indicating sandhi
	breaks, the conclusion is that it could either be added as an
	exception or allowed to change its property value, as the use
	of the code point is limited outside a special community. As
	including an exception would require implementation changes in
	deployed implementations of IDNA20008, the editor proposes
	that such a BackwardCompatible rule NOT to be added to
	IDNA2008.
      </t>
      <t>
	EDITOR PROPOSAL:
      </t>
      <t>
	The IETF has decided to NOT add a BackwardCompatible rule to IDNA2008 (i.e. Section 2.7 of <xref target='RFC5892'>RFC 5892</xref>) for this code point.
      </t>
      <t>

    <section><!-- CONVERT title= moved to <name> --><name>Conclusion</name>
      <t>
	As described in <xref target='changes'/> and
	<xref target='SHARADA'/>, changes have been made to Unicode
	between version 6.2.0 and 12.0.0. Some changes to specific
	characters changed their derived property value, whereas other
	changes did not.  Given the deployment considerations
	described in <xref target='deployment'/> and changes in the
	Unicode Standard described in <xref target='changes'/> and
	<xref target='SHARADA'/>, including implications to
	normalization, the conclusion of this document is to not add
	any exception rules to IDNA2008.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document addresses only changes to Unicode between
        version 6.2.0 and version 12.0.0.  Changes in future Unicode
        versions might result in the conclusion that exception rules
        need to be added to IDNA2008.  Separately from any changes in
        Unicode, the IETF might conclude that updates
        to <xref target='RFC5892'>RFC 5892</xref> or other IDNA2008
        documents might become necessary; such updates might include
        changes to the algorithm specified in IDNA2008 as well as
        additional rules, categories, or other forms of tuning.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section><!-- CONVERT title= moved to <name> --><name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>
	IANA is requested to update the IDNA Parameters registry of
	derived property values, after the expert reviewer validates
	that the derived property values are calculated correctly.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section><!-- CONVERT title= moved to <name> --><name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
	This document makes recommendations regarding the use of the
	IDNA2008 algorithm for calculation of derived property values,
	based on the Unicode version 12.0.0. This recommendation do not
	say anything about what recommendations to make for future
	versions of the Unicode Standard.
      </t>
      <t>
	Not following these recommendations can lead to various
	security issues. Specifically, allowing confusable characters
	may lead to various phishing attacks, as described in the Security
	Consideration Sections in the documents listed in section
	<xref target='idna2008'/>.
