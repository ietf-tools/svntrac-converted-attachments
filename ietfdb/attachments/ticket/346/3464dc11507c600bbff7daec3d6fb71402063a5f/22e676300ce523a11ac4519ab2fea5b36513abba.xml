      <abstract>
         <t>The productive output of an IETF working group is documents, as mandated by the working
            group's charter. When a working group is ready to develop a particular document, the
            most common mechanism is for it to "adopt" an existing document as a starting point. The
            document that a working group adopts and then develops further is based on initial input
            at varying levels of maturity. An initial working group draft might be a document
            already in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group,
            or it might represent any level of maturity in between. This document discusses how a
            working group typically handles the formal documents that it targets for publication.

      <section title="Introduction">
         <t>The productive output of an IETF working group (WG) is documents, as mandated by the working
            group's charter. Working groups develop these documents based on initial input at
            varying levels of maturity. An initial working group draft might be a document already
            in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group, or it
            might represent any level of maturity in between. This document discusses how a working
            group typically handles the formal documents that it targets for publication. The
            discussion applies only to the IETF and does not cover IRTF groups, where practices vary
            widely.</t>

         <t>Within the general constraints of formal IETF process and the specific constraints of a
            working group's charter, there can be considerable freedom in the adoption and
            development of drafts. As with most IETF activities, the ultimate arbiter of such
            choices is working group agreement, within the constraints of its charter. As with most
            working group management, this agreement might be explicit or implicit, depending upon
            the efficiencies that the group deems appropriate.</t>

         <section anchor="WhatIs" title="What Is a Working Group Draft?">

            <t>Working group drafts are documents that are subject to IETF Working Group revision
               control, with advancement for publication as an RFC requiring rough consensus in the
               working group and then in the broader IETF. Creation or adoption of a draft by a
               working group -- as well as substantive changes to the document -- need to represent
               working group rough consensus.</t>

            <t>Documents under development in the IETF community are distributed as Internet-Drafts
               (I-Ds) <xref target="RFC2026" /> <xref target="ID-Info" />. Working groups use this
               mechanism for producing their official output, per Section 7.2 of <xref
               target="RFC2418" /> and Section 6.3 of <xref target="Tao" />. The common
               convention for identifying an I-D formally under the ownership of a working group is
               by the inclusion of "ietf" in the second field of the I-D filename and the working
               group name in the third field, per Section 7 of <xref target="ID-Guidelines" />. That
               is: <figure>
                  <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[draft-ietf-<wgname>-...]]></artwork>
               </figure></t>
            <t>In contrast, individual submissions are drafts being created and pursued outside of a
               working group, although a working group might choose to adopt the draft later, as
               discussed below. Anyone is free to create an individual submission at any time. Such
               documents are typically distinguished through the use of the author/editor's last
               name, in the style of: <figure>
                  <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[draft-<lastname>-...]]> </artwork>
               </figure>(Also see <xref target="Indiv-WG" /> for an elaboration on this naming.)</t>
            <t>Responsibility for direct revision of a working group I-D is assigned to its editors
               and authors. See <xref target="authedit" /> for discussion about their selection and
               role.</t>

         </section>

         <section title="Working Group Authority and Consensus">
            <t>A premise of the IETF is that, within a working group, it is the working group itself
               that has final authority over the content of its documents, within the constraints of
               the working group's charter. No individual has special authority for the content. The
               chairs assign document authors/editors and can formulate design teams, but the
               content of working group documents is always, ultimately, subject to working group
               approval. Approval is described in terms of the IETF's "rough consensus" construct,
               which is the prime example of the IETF's preference for pragmatics over niceties.
               Unanimous agreement is always desirable, but more approximate (rough) agreement will
               suffice, as long as it is clear and strong. </t>

            <t>Other than for selection of document authors/editors, as discussed in <xref
                  target="authedit" />, working group decision-making about document management is
               subject to normal IETF rough consensus rules. Useful descriptions of this process for
               a working group are in Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC2418" /> and Section 4.2 of
                  <xref target="Tao" />. Discussion of the nature of rough consensus can be found in
                  <xref target="Consensus" />.</t>

            <t>In terms of the IETF's formal rough consensus processes, the working group explicitly
               develops, modifies, reviews, and approves document content, according to overt rough
               consensus. For difficult topics and/or difficult working group dynamics, this
               laborious process really is essential. Its diligence validates progress at each step
               along the way. However, working groups often handle simpler matters more simply, such
               as allowing a Chair to assert the likely agreement and then merely call for
               objections. Ultimately, the mode of working group decision-making is determined by
               the comfort and engagement of the working group with the way the decisions are being
               made.</t>

            <t> At times, a document author/editor can appear to have considerable authority over
               content, but this is (merely) for efficiency. That is, the chairs can permit authors
               and editors to proceed with an implied (default) working group agreement, as long as
               the working group is comfortable with that mode. Of course, the benefit in the mode is
               efficiency, but its risk is failure to retain or verify actual consensus among the
               working group participants. When a working group is operating in the mode of active,
               direct author/editor content development, an easy validation method is simply to have
               chairs query the working group when a new document version appears, asking for
               comments and concerns.</t>

            <t>In general, when it is not completely obvious what the opinion of the working group
               is, working group chairs can poll the working group to find out. As with any other
               consensus question, the form in which it is asked can make a difference. In
               particular, a general 'yes/no' question often is not as helpful as asking supporters
               and detractors of a draft -- or of the decision under consideration -- to provide
               their reasons, not merely their preferences. In effect, this treats the matter of
               consensus as an ongoing discussion. Ideally, the discussion can produce changes in
               the document or in participant views, or both.</t>

         <section title="Criteria for Adoption">

            <t>No formal specification for working group 'adoption' of a draft exists; the current
               document is meant to provide a description of common activities for this, but again
               note that it is not normative.</t>

                  <t>Is the topic of the I-D within scope for the working group?</t>
                  <t>Is the purpose of the draft sufficiently clear?</t>
                  <t>Does the document provide an acceptable platform for continued effort by
                           the working group?</t>

                  <t>Does the intended status of the document seem reasonable to the working
                           group? </t>
                  <t>If not already in scope, is a simple modification to the charter feasible
                           and warranted?</t>

                  <t>Is there strong working group support for working on the draft?</t>
                     </list></t>

            <t>Adoption has some basic pragmatics:<list>

                     Absent explicit agreement, adopting a document does not automatically mean that
                     the working group has agreed to all of its content. So a working group (or its

      <section anchor="authedit" title="Authors/Editors">

         <t>Document authors/editors are chosen by the working group chairs. Authors are described
            in Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC2418" />. Authors and editors are described in <xref
               target="RFC-Auth-Ed" />. <list style="hanging">
               <t hangText="NOTE: ">In this document, the terms 'author' and 'editor' are meant
                  interchangeably. Within the IETF the distinction between an 'editor' and an
                  'editor' is, at best, subjective. A simplistic rule of thumb is that editors tend
                  to do the mechanics of incorporating working group detail, whereas authors tend to
                  create the detail, subject to working group approval. That is, one role is more
                  active with the content and the other is more passive. It is a responsibility of
                  the working group chairs to ensure that document authors make modifications in
                  accord with working group rough consensus. Authors/editors are solely chosen by
                  the chairs -- although the views of the working group should be considered -- and
                  are subject to replacement for a variety of reasons, as the chairs see fit.</t>
            </list></t>

         <t>For existing documents that are being adopted by a working group, there is a special
            challenge in the selection of document editors: The document has already had editors. So
            the question is whether the same people are appropriate for continuing the task?
            Sometimes the answer is yes, but this is not automatic. The process within an IETF
            working group can be quite different from the process that created previous versions.
            This well might make it appropriate to select one or more new editors, either as
            additions to the editor team or as primary pen-holders (effectively re-classifying the
            previous team as co-authors). </t>

         <t>If the original editors are to continue in their role, the chairs might want to ensure
            that the editors understand IETF working group process; it is likely to be quite
            different from the process that developed earlier versions of the document. If
            additional or new editors are assigned, the transition can be discussed, including its
            reasons; this is best done as soon as possible.</t>
      </section>



      <section title="Document History and Stability">

         <t>Working group charters sometimes specify an initial set of existing documents to use as
            a basis of the working group's activities. That 'basis' can vary considerably, from
            simple input to working group discussion, all the way to an advanced draft adopted by
            the working group and subject only to minimal changes. The role of a document should be
            explicitly stated in the charter.</t>

         <t>Within the scope of its charter, a working group is free to create new documents. It is
            not required that all drafts start as the effort of an individual. Of course, the
            criteria for brand new documents are likely to be the same as for those imported into
            the working group with the additional and obvious requirement that the working group
            chairs will need to appoint authors/editors before any work can progress. Note that from
            time to time a working group will form a design team to produce the first version of a
            working group draft. Design teams are discussed in Section 6.5 of <xref target="RFC2418"
             />.</t>

         <t>Work that is brought to the IETF has different levels of completeness and maturity, and
            different timings for having achieved those levels. When the IETF charters a group and
            includes existing material, the charter can cast the role of that material in very
            different ways:</t>
<?rfc text-list-symbols="*o+-"?>
               <t><list style="symbols">
                     <t>It can treat it as no more than a set of ideas, to be used or ignored;</t>

                     <t>It can treat it as a basic design, with all of the actual details still
                        fluid;</t>

                     <t>It can treat it as a rough draft, subject to extensive revision;</t>

                     <t>It can treat it as a solid specification that merely needs review,
                        refinement and maybe enhancement;</t>

                     <t>It can treat it as a deployed technology that is best served by trying to
                        protect its installed base, but with some tolerance for changes that affect
                        interoperability;</t>

                     <t>It can treat it as a deployed technology for which protecting the installed
                        base is essential, including retention of core interoperability.</t>
                  </list></t>
            <t>These suggest a wide range of possible constraints on working group effort.
            Technology is brought to the IETF at different points of maturity along its lifecycle
            and the nature of the technology can have widely varying utility in developing an
            Internet standard. </t>

         <t> When technology is brand new, with at most some prototypes done as proofs of concept,
            then significant changes to the specification will not necessarily add much to the
            development and deployment costs. However, when the technology is already part of a
            mature and extensive operational deployment, incompatible changes are likely to be
            problematic for that market, which can hinder adoption of the
changes.

<!-- [rfced] Section 4:  It is not clear in this sentence what can
hinder adoption of the changes.  If the suggested text is not
correct, please clarify.

Original:
 However when the technology is already part of a mature and extensive
 operational deployment, incompatible changes are likely to be
 problematic for that market, which can hinder adoption of the
 changes.

Suggested:
 However, when the technology is already part of a mature and
 extensive operational deployment, incompatible changes are likely to
 be problematic for that market and can hinder adoption of the
 changes overall. -->

 For example,
            immediately after the development investment is made -- and especially when there has
            been considerable initial deployment -- but still room for quite a bit more -- the
            installed and potential base might not take kindly to disruptive standards work that
            undermines their recent investment. </t>

         <t>Conversely, even a deployed technology with a solid base might be inappropriate to
            deploy at Internet scale, and while a document specifying such a technology might serve
            as a good starting point on which to base a new specification, undermining of the
            deployed base might be completely appropriate. </t>

         <t>In reflecting upon the basis for adopting an existing draft and the way it will be used
            by the working group, it is important to consider the document's place in its lifecycle,
            the needs of any installed base, and the applicability of the draft's technology, when
            deciding on the constraints to impose on document development. It will all depend on the
            constraints of the charter and the analysis of the working group.</t>

      <section title="Some Issues for Consideration">
         <section anchor="Indiv-WG" title="Individual I-Ds under WG Care">

            <t>Sometimes, a working group facilitates a draft, but does not own it or formally adopt
               it. These are "individual" drafts <xref target="Individual" />.</t>

            <t>As noted in <xref target="WhatIs" /> and reinforced in <xref target="ID-Guidelines"
                />, the convention for identifying an I-D formally under the ownership of a working
               group is by following the naming convention: <figure>
                  <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[draft-ietf-<wgname>-...]]></artwork>
               </figure> By contrast, documents that are still under the control of their authors
               are known as "individual" I-Ds. When these documents are intended for consideration
               by a specific working group, the convention is that the document uses the naming
               convention as follows where the second element is the last name of one of the
               principal authors.<figure>
                  <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[draft-<lastname>-<wgname>...]]></artwork>
               </figure>Having the working group name following the personal name allows tools to
               associate these drafts with the working group, even though the filename identifies
               them as the work of individuals.</t>

            <t>The working group can choose to apply any of its normal, internal working group
               process management mechanisms to an Individual I-D. However, matters of ownership,
               working group final approval, and the like are all subject to negotiation amongst the
               document authors, working group and area directors.</t>

            <t>This is a rare situation and working group chairs can be assured that the Area
               Directors will want to understand why the document could not be adopted and owned by
               the working group. </t>
         </section>

         <section title="WG Drafts Can Become Individual Drafts">
            <t>A working group is not obligated to retain documents it has adopted. Sometimes
               working group efforts conclude that a draft is no longer appropriate for working
               group effort. If a working group drops a draft then anyone is permitted to pursue it
               as an Individual or Independent Submission, subject to the document's existing
               copyright constraints. </t>
         </section>

         <section title="Competing Drafts">

            <t>Engineering for interesting topics often produces competing, interesting proposals.
               The reasons can be technical aesthetics, engineering tradeoffs, architectural
               differences, company economics and the like. Although it is far more comfortable to
               entertain only one proposal, a working group is free to pursue more than one. Often
               this is necessary until a clear preference develops. Sometimes, multiple versions are
               formally published, absent consensus among the alternatives.</t>

            <t>It is appealing to ask authors of competing proposals to find a way to merge their
               work. Where it makes sense to do this, it can produce a single, strong specification.
               The detailed discussions to merge are often better held in a design team than amidst
               the dynamics of an open working group mailing list. The working group has ultimate
               authority over any decisions, but it is not required that it be involved in all the
               discussions.</t>

            <t>On the other hand, some differences cannot be resolved and attempting a merge can
               produce a weaker result. An example of this problem of conflicting design goals is
               discussed in <xref target="Heli-Sub" />, noting:<list>
                  <t>"Helicopters are great, and so are submarines. The problem is that if you try
                     to build one vehicle to perform two fundamentally different jobs, you're going
                     to get a vehicle that does neither job well."</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>Various management efforts can facilitate the handling of competing proposals. Some
               examples include:</t>
<?rfc text-list-symbols="-o*+"?>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                  <t>Develop a requirements document that is independent of specific
                           proposals; this can highlight features that are deemed essential, from
                           those that are of secondary importance, and facilitate a discussion about
                           features without reference to specific proposals.</t>
                  <t>Develop a comparison table of the proposals; this can aid understanding
                           of their differences.</t>
                  <t>Discuss the relative importance and effects of having one proposal,
                           versus multiple; this can focus people's efforts at compromise and
                           encourage a willingness to choose a single proposal.</t>
                     </list></t>

            <t>The problem of competing drafts can be particularly painful when it arises in either
               of two circumstances: <list>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                  <t>If a second proposal appears as a new draft, just as the chairs were
                           ready to poll the working group on adoption of the draft containing the
                           first proposal, then the authors of the first proposal could feel
                           affronted. It does not follow that the second draft was written to be
                           difficult or derail the first: it might even include better ideas. So it
                           is best not to disregard it. However, automatically asking the authors to
                           merge their work will not necessarily produce a more solid solution and
                           will not guarantee faster progress. This situation will be a judgement
                           call in each case, and it might help to ask the working group for their
                           opinion: shall the working group adopt one document as a starting point
                           and fold in the ideas from the second under the control of consensus, or
                           shall the working group wait until the authors of both documents have
                           reached agreement? </t>
                  <t>If the working group has already adopted an I-D on a specific topic, the
                           posting of a new individual I-D on the same topic could be seen as an
                           attack on the working group processes or decisions. However, posting an
                           I-D is often a good way to put new ideas into concrete form, for public
                           consideration and discussion. The working group chairs will want to
                           encourage the working group to consider the new proposal. Shall it be
                           adopted and entirely replace the current working group draft? Shall the
                           new ideas be incorporated into the work of the working group through the
                           normal editorial process? Shall the working group adopt a second
                           competing solution? Or shall the new draft be rejected and not adopted by
                           the working group?</t>
