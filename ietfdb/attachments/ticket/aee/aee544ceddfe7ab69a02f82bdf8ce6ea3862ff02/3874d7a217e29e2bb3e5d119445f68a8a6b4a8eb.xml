    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a backward-compatible technique that may be
      used by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise a
      router's unavailability to forward transit traffic, or to lower the
      preference level for the paths through such a router.</t>

      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 3137.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>In some situations, it may be advantageous to inform routers in a
      network not to use a specific router as a transit point, but still route
      to it. Possible situations include the following:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The router is in a critical condition (for example, has very high
          CPU load or does not have enough memory to store all Link State
          Advertisements (LSAs) or build the routing table).</t>

          <t>Graceful introduction and removal of the router to/from the
          network.</t>

          <t>Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note that the solution introduced in this document does not remove
      the router from the topology view of the network (as could be done by
      just flushing that router's router-LSA), but discourages other routers
      from using it for transit routing, while still routing packets to the
      router's own IP addresses, i.e., the router is announced as a stub.</t>

      <t>It must be emphasized that the solution provides real benefits in
      networks designed with at least some level of redundancy so that traffic
      can be routed around the stub router. Otherwise, traffic destined for
      the networks reachable through such a stub router may still be routed
      through it.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="solution" title="Solutions" toc="default">
      <t>The solution introduced in this document solves two challenges
      associated with the outlined problem. In the description below, router X
      is the router announcing itself as a stub.</t>

      <t><list style="format %d)">
          <t>Making other routers prefer routes around router X while
          performing the Dijkstra calculation.</t>

          <t>Allowing other routers to reach IP prefixes directly connected to
          router X.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note that it would be easy to address issue 1) alone by just flushing
      router X's router-LSA from the domain. However, it does not solve
      problem 2), since other routers will not be able to use links to router
      X in Dijkstra (no back link), and because router X will not have links
      to its neighbors.</t>

      <t>To address both problems, router X announces its router-LSA to the
      neighbors with the costs of all non-stub links (links of the types other
      than 3) set to MaxLinkMetric (defined in <xref
      target="maxlinkmetric"/>).</t>

      <t>The solution above applies to both <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC2328">OSPFv2</xref> and <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC5340">OSPFv3</xref>.</t>

      <section title="OSPFv3-only Solution" toc="default">
        <t><xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC5340">OSPFv3</xref> introduced additional options to
        provide similar control of the forwarding topology; the R-bit provides
        an indication of whether a router is active and should be used for
        transit traffic.</t>

        <t>It is left to network operators to decide which technique to use in
        their network. See <xref target="deploy"/> for more details.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="maxlinkmetric" title="Maximum Link Metric" toc="default">
      <t><xref format="default" pageno="false" target="solution"/> refers to
      the cost of all non-stub links as MaxLinkMetric, which is a new fixed
      architectural value introduced in this document.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="MaxLinkMetric"><vspace blankLines="0"/>The metric value
          indicating that the link described by an LSA should not be used as
          transit. Used in router-LSAs (see <xref format="default"
          pageno="false" target="solution"/>). It is defined to be the 16-bit
          binary value of all ones: 0xffff.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="deploy" title="Deployment Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>When using MaxLinkMetric, some inconsistency may be seen if the
      network is constructed of routers that perform intra-area Dijkstra
      calculation as specified in <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC1247"/> (discarding link records in router-LSAs that have a
      MaxLinkMetric cost value) and routers that perform it as specified in
      <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC1583"/> and higher (do
      not treat links with MaxLinkMetric cost as unreachable). Note that this
      inconsistency will not lead to routing loops, because if there are some
      alternate paths in the network, both types of routers will agree on
      using them rather than the path through the stub router. If the path
      through the stub router is the only one, the routers of the first type
      will not use the stub router for transit (which is the desired
      behavior), while the routers of the second type will still use this
      path.</t>

      <t>On the other hand, clearing the R-bit will consistently result in the
      router not being used as transit.</t>

      <t>The use of MaxLinkMetric or the R-bit in a network depends on the
      objectives of the operator. One of the possible considerations for
      selecting one or the other is in the desired behavior if the path
      through the stub router is the only one available. Using MaxLinkMetric
      allows for that path to be used, while the R-bit doesn't.</t>

                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
