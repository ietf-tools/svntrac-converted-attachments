                   <t>This specification specifies a Uniform Resource Name namespace for
                the GSMA (Global System for Mobile communications Association) and a Namespace Specific String 
                (NSS) for the IMEI (International Mobile station 
                Equipment Identity), and an associated parameter for the IMEISV (International 
                Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software Version number). 
                The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part of the specification for 
                Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) and are
                also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
                as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the Universal Mobile 
                Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution). 
                The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile Equipment 
                within these systems and are managed by the GSMA. URNs from this
                namespace almost always contain Personally Identifying
                Information and need to be treated accordingly.</t>

                <section title="Introduction">
                 <t>This specification specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
                 the GSMA (GSM Association) and a NSS for the IMEI (International 
                 Mobile station Equipment Identity), and associated parameter for the Software 
                  Version number from the IMEISV (International Mobile station Equipment Identity and 
                  Software Version number) as per the namespace registration requirement found in 
                 RFC 3406 <xref target="RFC3406"/>. The NID (Namespace Identifier) 'gsma' is for identities 
                 used in GSM, UMTS and LTE networks. The IMEI and the IMEISV 
                  are managed by the GSMA, so this
                 NID is managed by the GSMA. Whilst this specification currently 
                 specifies only the IMEI NSS under the 'gsma' NID,
                 additional NSS under the 'gsma' NID may be specified in the 
                 future by the GSMA using the procedure for URN NSS changes and additions
                 (currently through the publication of future Informational 
                 RFCs approved by IETF conensus).</t>
                 <t>The IMEI is 15 decimal digits long and includes a Type Allocation Code 
                    (TAC) of 8 decimal digits and a Serial Number (SNR) of 6 decimal digits 
                plus a Spare decimal digit. The TAC identifies the type of the Mobile 
                Equipment and is chosen from a range of values allocated to the Mobile
                Equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify the model of the Mobile 
                Equipment. The SNR is an individual serial number that uniquely identifies 
                each Mobile Equipment within the TAC. The Spare digit is used as a 
                check digit to validate the IMEI and is always set to the value 0 when 
                transmitted by the Mobile Equipment.</t>
                 <t>The IMEISV is 16 decimal digits long and includes the TAC and SNR same as for 
                    the IMEI but also a 2 decimal digit Software Version Number (SVN) which
                    is allocated by the Mobile Equipment manufacturer to identify the software 
                version of the Mobile Equipment.</t>
                 <t>The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
                    to use the IMEI and IMEISV as URNs.  Nothing in this document should 
                    be construed to override 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 23.003 <xref target="refs.TS-23.003"/> 
                    that specifies the IMEI and IMEISV.</t>
                 <t>The GSM Association (GSMA) is a global trade association representing 
                    nearly 800 mobile phone operators across 220 territories and 
                    countries of the world. The primary goals of the GSMA are to ensure 
                    mobile phones and wireless services work globally and are easily accessible. 
                    Further details about the GSMA role in allocating the IMEI and the IMEISV 
                    and the IMEI and IMEISV allocation guidelines can be found in 
                    GSMA Permanent Reference Document (PRD) TS 06 <xref target="refs.DG.06"/>. </t>

                 <t>The optional 'vers' parameter and the 'ext-imei' field in the ABNF are included for 
                    extensibility of the IMEI NSS, for example if the IMEI format is extended in the future
                   (such as with additional digits or using hex digits). In this case the 'vers' parameter 
                    would contain a non zero value and the 'ext-imei' would be further defined to represent
                    the syntax of the extended IMEI format. A value of the 'vers' parameter equal to 0 or
                    the absence of the 'vers' parameter means the URN format is 
                    compliant with the format specified here. Any change to the format specified here requires 
                    the use of the procedure for URN NSS changes and additions (currently the publication of a future                     Informational RFCs approved by IETF consensus). The reason why use of the 'vers' parameter was chosen
                    for extensibility instead of defining a new NSS (e.g. 'imei2') is that it is likely that many applications 
                    will only need to perform string compares of the 'imeival'. So even if the format or length of the
                    'imeival' changes in the future, such applications should continue to work without having to be updated
                    to understand a new NSS.</t>

                 parameter other than equal to 0 or the definition of additional parameters that are intended to be used as part
                 of an instance ID will require an update to draft-allen-dispatch-imei-urn-as-instanceid-13

                   <t>GSM, UMTS and LTE mobile devices will be interoperating with Internet
                   devices for a variety of voice and data services. To do this, they
                   need to make use of Internet protocols that will operate end to end
                   between devices in GSM/UMTS/LTE networks and those in the general
                   internet. Some of these protocols require the use of URN's as
                   identifiers. Within the GSM/UMTS/LTE networks, mobile devices are
                   identified by their IMEI or IMEISV. Internet users will need to be
                   able to receive and include the GSMA URN in various Internet protocol
                   elements to facilitate communication between pure internet based
                   devices and GSM/UMTS/LTE mobile devices. Thus the existence and syntax
                   of these namespaces needs to be available to the general internet
                   community and the namespace needs to be reserved with IANA in order to
                   guarantee uniqueness and prevent potential namespace conflicts both
                   within the internet and within GSM/UMTS/LTE networks. Conversely, 
                  Internet implementations will not generally possess IMEI identifiers. 
                  The identifiers generated by such implementations will typically be URNs 
                  within namespaces other than 'gsma', and may, depending on context, even 
                  be non-URN URIs. Implementations are advised to be ready to process URIs 
                  other than 'gsma' namespaced URNs, so as to aid in interoperability.</t>

                that are used to transport device identifiers  often require the device identifier to be

                   <t>IMEIs (but with the Spare value set to the value of the Check Digit) are displayable 
                on most mobile devices and in many cases are printed on the case within the battery compartment.
                Anyone with brief physical access to the mobile device can therefore easily obtain the IMEI. 
                Therefore IMEIs MUST NOT be used as security capabilities 
                (identifiers whose mere possession grants access). Unfortuantely there are currently examples of some
                applications which are using the IMEI for authorisation. Also some service provider's customer
                service departments have been known to use knowledge of the IMEI as "proof" that the caller is the 
                legitimate owner of the mobile device. Both of these are inappropriate uses of the IMEI.</t>
                   <t>Whilst the specific software version of the mobile device only identifies the lower layer software that
                   has undergone and passed certification testing and not the operating system or application software, the software version could identify software that is vulnerable to attacks or is known to contain 
                   security holes. Therfore the IMEISV MUST only be delivered to trusted entities
                within carrier networks and not provided to the internet at large,
                as it could help a malicious device identify that the mobile device is running 
                software that is known to be vulnerable to certain attacks.
                This is a similar concern to the use of the 
                User-Agent header in SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) as specified in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/>.
                Therefore the IMEISV (that is, the IMEI URN with a 'svn' parameter) MUST NOT be delivered to devices 
                that are not trusted. IMEIs are almost always as personally identifiable 
                information and so these URNs MUST be treated
                as personally identifiable information in all cases. 
                In order to prevent violating a user's privacy the IMEI URN MUST NOT be included in messages 
                intended to convey any level of anonymity.</t>  
                <t>Since the IMEI is permanently assigned to the mobile device and is not modified when the ownership of the
                mobile device changes, (even upon a complete software reload of the device),  the IMEI URN MUST NOT be used as a user 
                identifier or user address by an application. Using the
                IMEI to identify a user or as a user address could result in communications destined for a previous owner of a device being 
                received by the new device owner or allow the new device owner to access information or services owned by the previous 
                device owner.</t>
                <t>Additionally, since the IMEI identifies the mobile device, it potentially could be used to identify and
                track users for the purposes of survellience and call data mining if sent in the clear.</t>
                <t>Since the IMEI is personally identifiable information uses of the IMEI URN
                with IETF protocols require a specification and IETF expert review in order to 
                ensure that the privacy concerns are appropriately addressed. Protocols
                carrying the IMEI URN SHOULD at a minimum use strongly hop-by-hop encrypted             
                channels and that it is RECOMMENDED that end-to-end encryption is used</t>

                Specifically the

                It SHALL resist tampering, i.e. manipulation and change, by any means (e.g.
